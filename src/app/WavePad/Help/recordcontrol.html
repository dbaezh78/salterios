Record Control Window<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The Record Control window is where you make your recordings and listen to them. You can also specify what sound recording device you want to use as well as auto start and auto trim settings.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>File Info</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Name</i> - the name of the file to which you are recording.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Playback</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Device</i> - select the playback sound device you want to use.  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Volume</i> - set the playback volume level.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Recording</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Device</i> - select the recording sound device you want to use.  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Input</i> - select the recording channel you want to use.  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Volume</i> - set the recording volume level.  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Advanced Record Options:</i>  <p>
 <p>
  <b>Auto Start Recording</b> - if selected, the recording will only start if audio is detected (i.e. it will not record if there is just silence).  <p>
 <p>
  <b>Auto Trim Recording</b> - if selected, the start and end of the recording will be trimmed of silence.  <p>
 <p>
  <b>Voice Activated Recording</b> - if selected, this will only record if the audio volume level is above what you specify for the &quot;Threshold&quot; setting.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
 <p>
The recording window also has a wave window where you will be able to see the audio waveform after it has been recorded. After recording, you can manually navigate to any portion of the audio using the scrollbar, and either play your audio or record again. Note that performing either action will either play or record the audio from the position of the green cursor in the wave window.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Along the bottom of the window you will see a number of buttons that are used for playback and recording of audio. These buttons are as follows:<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Record</i> - commences the recording. Recording will start from wherever the green cursor is located (F5).  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Play</i> - plays the recording. Playback will commence from wherever the green cursor is located (space).  <p>
  <p>
   <i>Pause</i> - Pauses playback.   <p>
 <p>
  <i>Stop</i> - stops recording or playback of the audio (Esc).  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Go to Start</i> - sets the green cursor back to the start of the audio recording (Home).  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Rewind</i> - moves backwards through the audio while playing it back (Left Arrow).  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Fast Forward</i> - moves forwards through the audio while playing it back (Right Arrow).  <p>
 <p>
  <i>Go to End</i> - sets the green cursor to the end of the audio recording (End).  <p>
