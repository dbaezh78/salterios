 <h1>WavePad Options ~ Audio Processing Tab</h1>  <h2>Sound Play Device</h2>  <p>
This is where you select the sound device you would like to WavePad to use for playing back audio files. If you have more than one sound card installed, select the sound card you want using the Sound Play Device pull down list.<p>
 <p>
If you are an advanced user, you may also like to choose which sound driver model you want to use. If your sound card supports DirectSound or ASIO, simply select your desired sound device from the list prepended with [DirectSound] or [ASIO].<p>
 <h2>Auto Trim Threshold</h2>  <p>
  This setting applies to the function Edit -&gt; Auto Trim. See the heading under <a href="EDITING.html">Editing</a> for more information.  <p>
 <h2>Audio Working Folder</h2>  <p>
When WavePad loads a file it keeps a copy of the working audio (in full quality 32 bit) in the working folder for fast editing and processing. If you are running out of hard drive space on your C drive you can change this to be some other temporary folder.<p>
 <p>
<b>Please note:</b> This is a temporary folder and should not be used for storing any data you wish to keep. It is strongly advised not to save any files to this directory as they may be deleted without warning.<p>
