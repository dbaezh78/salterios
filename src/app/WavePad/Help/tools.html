Tools<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Frequency Analysis</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This tool uses a Discrete Fast Fourier Transform (DFFT) to separate the audio at the current selected position of the waveform into its frequency components. To use it, set the waveform cursor to the point in the audio you want to analyse and select Tools -&gt; Frequency Analysis. In the window that opens, you should see one or two graphs displayed, known as FFT graphs. If the audio file you are analysing is of mono format, there will be one blue graph shown. If the file is stereo, there will be one blue graph for the left channel and one pink graph for the right channel.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
In the top right-hand hand corner are the frequency and decibel values of the point in the graph where the mouse cursor is currently located. The decibel values range from 0dB (loudest) at the top, down to -127dB (softest). The frequency range depends on the sample rate of the audio file, ranging from 0Hz on the left to half the sample rate of the audio at the right.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
To see the FFT graph in more detail, click the Zoom In buttons on either the bottom of the window or along the right-side (this will zoom the graph horizontally or vertically respectively). While zoomed in, you can use the scrollbars along the bottom and right-hand sides to scroll horizontally or vertically.<p>
 <p>
To zoom the graph out, either click on the respective Zoom Out buttons, or click the button in the bottom-right corner to set the view back to full-scale.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
An alternative to using the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons is simply resizing the FFT graph window. To do this, move the mouse cursor to any edge or corner of the window, and hold the left-mouse button down and move your mouse as appropriate.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Temporal Frequency Analysis</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This tool calculates an FFT analysis over time (TFFT), and uses colour to display the intensities of the spectral information. To use it, select an area of the audio waveform you would like to analyse and select Tools -&gt; Temporal Frequency Analysis. In the window that opens, you should see a graph displayed, known as the TFFT graph. Time is represented along the horizontal axis and has a range the same as the region of the audio waveform you have selected. Frequency goes along the vertical axis, and goes from zero to half the sample rate of the audio waveform. The colours represent the decibel levels for a specific frequency at a specific point in time, with brighter colours meaning stronger intensities. The decibel values range from 0 (loudest) down to -127dB (softest). The values of time, frequency and decibels can be viewed in the status bar at the bottom of the TFFT window, and will depend on where your mouse cursor is currently located in the graph.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
If you are performing an analysis on a stereo waveform, you will see the effect of both channels combined into the one graph.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
To view spectral information in the 0 - 4000Hz range, click on the zoom button in the top right-hand corner of the graph. To view the graph at normal zoom, click the button directly below it.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The slider bar lets you change the brightness levels of the graph to either dim or highlight the lower intensity areas. Move the slider up to increase the brightness, and move it down to decrease the brightness.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
If you feel the gridlines of the graph are obstructing your view of the analysis, then you can turn them off by toggling the button in the lower-right corner of the window (&quot;Toggle the gridlines on or off&quot;).<p>
 <p>
 <p>
You can also play the selected area of the audio waveform and watch the cursor move along both the audio and the TFFT graph. This will help you to relate what's going on in the audio to what is going on in the graph. You can also left-click your mouse on any point in either the audio or the TFFT graph to set the cursor at that point.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
If you have per-chance lost the selection area being analysed in the audio waveform, you can get it back by clicking the appropriate button in the lower-right corner of the TFFT window (&quot;Reselect this analysis region in the audio waveform&quot;). Note that you cannot select regions in the TFFT graph - to get the graph to analyse a different part of the audio, you must select that part in the audio waveform itself and re-run the TFFT analysis.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Auto Click/Pop Restoration</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This tool is designed to remove click and pop sounds from recordings. It is ideal for those who have recorded music onto their computer from LP records and want to repair any defects caused by dust and scratches on the vinyl.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
To use the tool, click Tools menu -&gt; Auto Click/Pop Restoration. In the window that appears, you can configure settings for the following fields:<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Maximum Click Length</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This is the maximum length that a click lasts in your audio, in milliseconds. As a general guide, use 450ms if you don't know what to enter. 350ms is appropriate for audio with only small amounts of defects, whereas 550ms or 650ms is appropriate for audio with lots of defects.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Click Sensitivity</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This is the degree of agressiveness (as a percentage) that will be applied by the tool when searching for click and pop artefacts. If you don't know what to enter, you can start by leaving it at 50%. The more a piece of audio is damaged, the higher you may have to set it. Moderately damaged audio can require settings of 60% - 80%. Be careful though - if you set it too high, the tool will start thinking parts of the audio are actually clicks/pops. If you set it too low of course, the tool will think some clicks/pops are part of the audio. Try experimenting to find the right value, and note that the level you apply to one file may be different to the level you apply in another file.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Manual Click/Pop Reduction</b>  <p>
  <p>
  <p>
This tool allows you to apply a manual repair of a single click/pop artefact. To use it properly, you must zoom right in to the artefact and select a small region around it. Then select Tools menu -&gt; Manual Click/Pop Reduction. The reduction will be performed straight away.<p>
  <p>
  <p>
  <b>Tone Generator</b>  <p>
  <p>
  <p>
The Tone Generator plugin can be used to generate sine, square, triangle tones, pink or white noise, composite tones (eg. DTMF tones).<p>
  <p>
  <p>
Open Tone Generator using the menu Tools -&gt; Tone Generator. For more information about using Tone Generator press F1 from within Tone Generator.<p>
  <p>
   <p>
  <b>Text To Speech (Speech Synthesis)</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This tool lets you create computer generated speech from text you enter. Use the menu Tools -&gt; Text to Speech, enter (or paste Ctrl+V) the text and click Synthesize Speech. Some trial and error can be required to get it right. For example spell out numbers &quot;1 thousand 2 hundred&quot; and acronyms &quot;N. C. H. Swift Sound&quot;.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  This feature requires a speech engine which is not installed on all computers. To download the Microsoft speech engine (or for foreign language speech engines) please see <a href="http://www.nch.com.au/speech/index.html">www.nch.com.au/speech</a>.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Batch Converter</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  If you have a large number of files that you want to process in the same way use the Batch Converter Tool (Tools -&gt; Batch Converter). You specify the list of files, the list of effects to be applied and WavePad will do them all in one 'batch'. For more information on doing this, please see the topic <a href="BATCH.html">Batch Converter</a>.  <p>
        <p>
            <b>Sound Library</b>         <p>
        <p>
        <p>
            WavePad gives you access to a Sound Library containing 800 SFX files and 200 music files. Access the Sound Library from Tools -&gt; Sound Library. This will bring up a dialog containing files with the sound effects organized by category.<p>
        <p>
        <p>
            Preview a sound by selecting a sound category from the left panel, and then a sound file from the category list. Click the play button at the bottom of the window to hear the sound. If you decide you would like to download the sound, click the large 'Download' button located in the bottom right corner of the window. The WavePad Master's Edition comes with unlimited access to the Sound Library, otherwise, users will be limited to three downloads.         <p>
        <p>
        <p>
             <b>Note:</b> You must have an Internet connection to preview and/or download from the Sound Library.         <p>
