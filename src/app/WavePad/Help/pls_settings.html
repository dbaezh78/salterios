PLS Playlist Settings<p>
 <p>
PLS files are text files that contains links to the locations of the actual audio files specified within the playlist file. It does not contain any audio itself. PLS files can be loaded into WinAmp (http://www.winamp.com)<p>
 <p>
 <p>
In WavePad, PLS support extends specifically towards streaming an audio file off an Internet server - it is currently limited in its other uses. When you save to a PLS file the following components are generated by WavePad:<p>
 <p>
 <p>
- PLS file: the file you play in WinAmp.<p>
 <p>
- MP3 file: the file containing your audio recording.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
To create your PLS playlist from scratch, you can use WavePad for both recording and editing. To upload your MP3 file to an Internet server, you can use the FTP feature of WavePad (assuming the server supports FTP). Go to File menu -&gt; Send... and choose the FTP upload option. Both PLS and MP3 files must be uploaded if you want others to use your playlist. To test your playlist out, download the PLS file from the Internet server and then play it in WinAmp.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The settings dialog for the PLS Playlist is as follows:<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Root URL</i> - The URL where you will upload or store the audio file. This URL can have the following formats:  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Absolute URLs</b> - after creating PLS files with absolute URLs, you can put the PLS file anywhere and play it, as long as you can access the audio file via http or if its on your computer or LAN.  <p>
 <p>
- Standard http URL e.g. http://www.music.com/ <p>
 <p>
- File URL on your local computer e.g. C:\music\ <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Relative URLs</b> - the PLS files must be put in specific locations relative to the audio file.  <p>
 <p>
- Relative to the root folder e.g. if you specify &quot;\music&quot; and you play your PLS file from anywhere on your C:\ drive, it will look for the audio file in the path &quot;C:\music&quot;<p>
 <p>
- Relative to the directory e.g. if you specify &quot;music&quot; and you play your PLS file in the folder &quot;C:\mp3s&quot;, it will look for the audio file in the path &quot;C:\mp3s\music&quot;<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>MP3 Settings</i> - Click the &quot;MP3 Settings&quot; button to open the MP3 settings configuration where you can set the format for the MP3 recording (for more information see the <a href="MP3_SETTINGS.html">MP3 Settings</a> dialog.  <p>
