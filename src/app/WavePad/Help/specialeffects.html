Special Effects<p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Reduce Vocals</b>  <p>
  <p>
  <p>
If you want to reduce the vocals from a music track you can use this effect. WavePad will attempt to identify the voice in the left-to-right spectrum of a stereo recording and remove it. The recording must be stereo (from an original stereo source like a CD - simply converting a file to stereo will not work). It will also remove any instruments near the voice in the stereo spectrum.<p>
  <p>
  <p>
  Note: it is impossible to remove the vocals perfectly without the original mix track.   You will notice some instruments might be removed too and some vocal remain.   The effect will also not work on some files which have previously encoded in a   highly compressed form like mp3 (because this remove some stereo depth).  <p>
  <p>
   <p>
  <b>Phaser</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
The phaser sound effect is created by mixing a slightly delayed signal with the original. You can set the delay in ms (default 5ms) and the wet dry gain in percent. 100% is wet. 0% is off/dry.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Flanger</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
A Flanger sound effect is similar to the phaser except that the delay is slowly modulated over time. You specify the starting delay time (default 5ms), the frequency of modulation in times per second (default 0.5Hz which is 2 seconds) the depth of modulation (default 50%) and the wet dry gain (100% for we, 0% for dry).<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Chorus</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
The chorus sound effect is used to make one voice or one instrument sound like 3 voices or instruments by playing the original with variably delayed and slightly pitch changed copies of the original.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Note: Chorus is a very useful way to make a mono source sound more stereo. You should convert your file to stereo first before using Chorus.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Distortion</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
While normally we do everything to reduce distortion, sometimes you want to add it. It is popular for use with guitars. The distortion is measured between 0.0 (off and 1.0 clipping). You also specify the level where it kicks in in dB (default -8db).<p>
 <p>
 <p>
For a more consistent sound, you should apply Dynamic Range Compression first before you add distortion.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>AM Radio</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This simulates an AM Radio. We have made it accurately simulate a 'good' AM radio. To make it worse, apply the effect twice. For a really bad sound, paste mix some soft white noise (use the Tone Generator tool) to simulate bad reception.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Telephone</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This simulates the audio down a telephone line. It simulates a 'good' telephone line. To make it worse apply the effect twice and paste mix soft white noise.<p>
