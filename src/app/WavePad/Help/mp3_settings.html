 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Constant Bitrate Encoding (CBR)</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Select this option to encode the audio using a constant bit rate. The specific bitrate value can be selected from the bitrate drop-down list.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The &quot;High Quality&quot; checkbox option produces a better quality output but slows down the audio encoding process.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Variable Bitrate Encoding (VBR)</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Select this option to encode the audio using a variable bit rate, which is considered to produce superior results to CBR encoding. For this mode you must select minimum and maximum bitrates from the respective bitrate drop-down lists.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The &quot;Quality&quot; option affects the audible quality of the file, with a higher quality yielding a higher file size for the resulting MP3 file. Note that the number 0 will produce the highest quality and highest file size.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Note:</b> Depending on what bitrate(s) are set, the encoder will set the output sample rate accordingly.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Channels</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This selects if the MP3 file will be Stereo, Joint, Force or Mono. Force means that the encoding process will force ms_stereo for all frames, which is faster.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Note:</b> If the source file is Mono, the converted file will likely end up being Mono as well. <b>This is not a bug!</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Error Protection</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This option adds additional CRC information into the MP3 file, and protects against small corruptions that may later develop due to faulty media on which the file is stored.<p>
