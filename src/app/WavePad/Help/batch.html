Batch Converter<p>
 <p>
 <p>
The batch converter is used where you want to apply the same operations (i.e. effects or conversions) to a whole list of files.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  Note:- this feature is only available on WavePad Master's Edition. To purchase an upgrade see <a href="http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/register/index.html">www.nch.com.au/wavepad/register</a>.  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Open the Batch Converter using the menu Tools -&gt; Batch Converter.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Step 1: Select Files</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Click on the Add button and browse to the files you want to process. You can select multiple files at the same time by holding down the Shift or Control keys while selecting.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Click Next when you have added all the files.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Step 2: Select Commands</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
For each command you want to apply to the files, click Add select the command and then click Add again. You can reorder commands by dragging the items in the list.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Step 3: Select Output Format and Folder</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
By default WavePad will save the files in the same format they were loaded in. But if you want to convert the format select &quot;Convert to file format&quot;, select the extension. Some files (eg. wav or mp3) have other options (bitrate or codec) which can be changed using format options.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Note:</b> if you want to change the sample rate use the Convert Sample Rate comment in the commands (above).  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Files are normally saved in the same folder they were loaded from. This means they will be overwritten when saved. Alternatively you can select a different folder to save the files to.<p>
