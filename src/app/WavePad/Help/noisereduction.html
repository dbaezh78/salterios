Noise Reduction<p>
 <p>
 <p>
WavePad has 2 ways of reducing noise. The slow but accurate &quot;Spectral Subtraction&quot; method - usually used where noise is really a problem - and the fast &quot;Multiband Noise Gates&quot; method - usually just just automatically on batch voice recording jobs.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Sometimes using both (spectral always must be first) then multiband gates works very well.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Spectral Subtraction</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Automatic Method</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This approach leaves WavePad to estimate what is noise and what is not. It usually works well on voice and is nice and easy to use just select the region and apply the effect.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <i>Manual Method</i>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To use this you must:<p>
 <p>
1. Select a short part of 'noise only'. Usually this is from a gap in the audio.<p>
 <p>
2. &quot;Grab Noise Sample From Selected Area&quot;.<p>
 <p>
3. Select the entire file.<p>
 <p>
4. &quot;Apply Spectral Subtraction Based on Noise Sample&quot;.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Multiband Noise Gates</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To use the all you need to do is enter the level below which you expect noise. Usually this is between -30dB and -20dB. If not enough noise is reduced increase the value. If too much is reduced decrease it.<p>
