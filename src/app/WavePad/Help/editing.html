 <h1>Editing</h1>  <h2>Selected Region</h2>    <p>
Many of the edit functions below apply to the selected region. To mark the selected region you can either click and hold down on the wave window and drag the mouse or press and hold down the shift key while moving in the file. To select the entire file press Ctrl+A.<p>
     <p>
  <b>Undo</b> (Ctrl+Z)  <p>
   <p>
To Undo is to restore the file to its state before the previous edit function. This is useful if you want to try an edit or just make a mistake. To undo your last action press Ctrl+Z.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <i>Note:</i> You can undo up to 32 last actions.  <p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Cut</b> (Ctrl+X)  <p>
     <p>
 <p>
To 'cut' is to delete the selected region but to keep a copy on the clipboard so it can be 'pasted' somewhere else. This is useful when moving parts of the audio around in the file.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
To cut select the region and then press Ctrl+X.<p>
     <p>
   <p>
  <b>Copy</b> (Ctrl+C)  <p>
     <p>
 <p>
To 'copy' is to make a copy of the selected region to the clipboard so you can paste it in another location. This is useful if you want to duplicate a part of the audio and insert (or mix it) in another file.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
To copy select the region and then press Ctrl+C. To copy the entire file press Ctrl+A-C.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <b>Copy To New</b>  <p>
 <p>
To create a new file with a selected part of the current file, select the region and use the menu Edit -&gt; Copy To New. Alternatively, you can hold down the control key and drag the selected area with the mouse to a blank area of the WavePad workspace.<p>
   <p>
  <b>Paste</b> (Ctrl+V)  <p>
     <p>
 <p>
Paste can only be used after you have used the Cut or Copy functions (above) to take a selected region to the clipboard.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
The paste function replaces the current selected region (or inserts if there is no selection). To replace a selection press Ctrl+V. To insert click on the position and press Ctrl+V.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <b>Paste Mix</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This function takes the audio you have previous copied or cut and mixes it with the current selected region.<p>
 <p>
After you have cut or copied the audio you want to mix select the new region and used Edit -&gt; Paste Mix from the menu. You can specify the volume of the mix (that is the volume of the clipboard audio).<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Almost always the length of the selected regions will be different. If the mix selection (in the clipboard) is shorter than the current selection then the mixed audio will just end when it ends. If the mix clipboard is longer than the current selection then one of the follow can be selected. &quot;Increase selection&quot; means that the mix just continues past the end until the mix file ends. &quot;Insert Silence&quot; means at the end of the current selection, the mix will be inserted until it ends. The fade out mix means that as the end of the current selection is approach the mix fades out - this is useful for background music beds and sfx.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
A typical example of Paste Mix is where you want to mix a music bed behind a voice over. To do this copy the music track from one file, open the voice file select the voice (say with Ctrl+A) then select Edit -&gt; Paste Mix and fade out mix.<p>
  <p>
     <p>
If the file you are pasting into is stereo you can select the stereo position of the file to be pasted. For example if you are paste-mixing a sound effect you can place that sound towards the left by sliding the pan fader left.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Delete</b> (Del)  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To delete the selected region press the Delete key. This is similar to the cut function but a copy is not taken to the clipboard.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Select All</b> (Ctrl+A).  <p>
     <p>
   <p>
To select the whole file press Ctrl+A.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <b>Select To Start</b> (Shift+Home).  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To select from the beginning position to the current position, press Shift+Home.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Select To End</b> (Shift+End).  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To select from the current position to the end, press Shift+End.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Select Specified Time</b> (Ctrl+G).  <p>
  <p>
  <p>
Use this option if you want to select the audio with the exact start and end position. Just press Ctrl+G, enter the start and end position and click OK. You can also preview the selection by clicking the Preview button.<p>
  <p>
   <p>
  <b>Mix File</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This is the same as Paste Mix (above) except that you specify a file to mix instead of having to copy the audio to the clipboard first. See the Paste Mix section above for more information.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Repeat Loop</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
This function repeats the selection a number of times (useful for extending the length of music beds). Select the region you want to repeat and use the menu Edit -&gt; Repeat Loop then enter the number of times to loop.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
  <b>Trim</b> (Ctrl+T)  <p>
     <p>
 <p>
To 'trim' is to cut off the beginning and the end of the file so only the selected region remains. This is useful when you have just recorded a file but there is silence or noise before the start or after the end.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
Select the part of the file you want to keep and then press Ctrl+T.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <b>Trim Start</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To delete everything before the current position select Edit -&gt; Trim Start.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Trim End</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
To delete everything after the current position select Edit -&gt; Trim End.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Auto Trim</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Auto Trim removes the silence at the beginning and the end of the selected region without you needing to find the exact position where recording starts.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
Auto Trim works by scanning the region for the peak level then removing the start and end that is below the Auto Trim Threshold Level below the peak. The Auto Trim Threshold Level can be adjusted through Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Audio Processing tab. The default is -20 db. Increase this to -15 in noisy environments. Decrease to -24 in a studio.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
This feature will not be useful in an environment with high background noise, as WavePad will be unable to differentiate between the background sounds and your voice.<p>
 <p>
   <p>
Auto Trim applies to the selected region. Often you might want to Select All (Ctrl+A) first before using Auto Trim.<p>
     <p>
 <p>
  <b>Split into two at this point</b>  <p>
 <p>
 <p>
Use this option if you want to quickly split the current file into two small tracks. To do this, click on the position where you want to split and select Edit-&gt;Split into two at this point. Take care when you decide to do this because you cannot undo.<p>
 <p>
 <b>Auto Split</b>  <p>
 <p>
Use this option if you want WavePad to auto split the file by detecting silence below a specified threshold level for a specified duration. You can specify the threshold below which is considered silence (default -36db) and the minimum duration which will be considered silence (default: 0ms). Take care when you decide to do this because you cannot undo.<p>
 <p>
 <p>
  <b>Save Select Region As</b>  <p>
 <p>
This function saves the selected region. This function can be useful to quickly save out the part that you have just edited.<p>
  <b>Silence Selected Region</b>  <p>
 <p>
This function silences the selected region. This function can be useful to remove breaths or clicks from a voice recording without changing the timing of the words.<p>
  <p>
 <p>
  <b>Insert File</b>  <p>
 <p>
The menu item Edit -&gt; Insert File is used to insert a specific audio file at or over the selection location.<p>
 <p>
  <b>Insert Silence</b>  <p>
 <p>
The menu item Edit -&gt; Insert Silence is used to insert silence of a specified duration at or over the selected location.<p>
 <p>
  <b>Convert Sample Rate and Convert Channels</b>  <p>
 <p>
WavePad can convert a file's sample rate or number of channels. This change applies to the whole file (you cannot change just parts of the file).<p>
 <p>
To convert the sample rate of the current file use the menu Edit -&gt; Convert Sample Rate and select the new sample rate. The sample rate must be between 6000 and 96000 samples per second. Typical sample rates are displayed in the pull down list.<p>
 <p>
To convert the channels of the current file (stereo to mono or visa versa) select Edit -&gt; Convert Channels.<p>
 <p>
  A typical reason for converting the sample rate down is when you know it is going to be used on the telephone (8000 mono) or if you are about to compress the file for internet transmission (eg. GSM takes 11025 or 8000 mono). For a broad explanation about sample rates see <a href="CONCEPTS.html">General Audio Concepts</a>.  <p>
 <p>
  <b>Edit Audio Tags</b>  <p>
 <p>
Certain audio file types contain what are known as Audio Tags. These tags are embedded in the file itself and contain metadata about the file such as Artist, Date of production, Song Title, Album and many others.<p>
 <p>
WavePad is able to view and edit these tags for wave, mp3, flac, ogg and wma file types.<p>
 <p>
  <b>Sample Editing Mode</b>  <p>
 <p>
Sample edit mode allows you to modify individual audio samples using your computer's mouse. It is useful for manually editing out clicks and pops from noisy recordings.<p>
 <p>
To edit a sample, zoom in on the audio waveform until the individual samples become visible (they will appear as vertical lines). Click on Sample Editing Mode from the menu or select the pen icon from just below the waveform and edit the amplitude of a sample by holding down the left mouse button and adjusting it's height.<p>
 <p>
  <b>Mark First Position / Mark Second Position / Recall Mark Selection</b>  <p>
 <p>
These Edit menu options can be used to mark and then recall any segment of the current file. Use Mark First Position to mark the beginning of the selection, and Mark Second Position to mark the end of the selection. The selected region between the first and second marked positions on the audio file can then be returned to later through use of the Recall Mark Selection option.<p>
