Beginning of the public life: Baptism, first Passover, first miracles, preaching 
and disciples</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Jun 26 - Nov 27)
<BR>
The 
<A HREF="#ss01">preaching of John the Baptist</A>
in the Jordan prepares the gospel (Jun 26).
John
<A HREF="#ss02">reprehends the pharisees</A>,
<A HREF="#ss03">preaches to the people</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss04">announces the coming of the Messiah</A>.
<BR>
Jesus comes from Galilee; he is
<A HREF="#ss05">baptized by John</A>
(Dec 26) and withdraws into the desert of Judea, where he
<A HREF="#ss06">fasts forty days and is tempted by Satan</A>
(Jan 27).
<BR>
He returns later to the region of the Jordan, where he receives
<A HREF="#ss07">new testimonies from the Baptist</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss10">calls his first disciples</A>.
<BR>
He returns to Galilee and performs his first miracle in
<A HREF="#ss14">the wedding feast at Cana</A>
(Feb 27).
<BR>After a brief
<A HREF="#ss15">journey to Capernaum</A>, 
Jesus goes to Jerusalem to attend
<A HREF="#ss16">the first Passover</A> during his public life (Mar 27).
 There he
<A HREF="#ss17">expels the merchants from the temple</A>
and is 
<A HREF="#ss18">questioned by the Jews</A>.
He reveals his condition of unique Son of God in the
<A HREF="#ss20">conversation with Nicodemus</A>.
Thereafter he stays several months preaching in the region of Judea, 
while John the Baptist announces that
<A HREF="#ss21">he must decrease so that Jesus grows</A> 
(April-Nov 27).

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:20</FONT>&nbsp; He confessed, and didn't deny, but he confessed, &quot;I am not the Christ.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:21</FONT>&nbsp; They asked him, &quot;What then? Are you Elijah?&quot; He said, &quot;I am not.&quot; &quot;Are you the Prophet?&quot; He answered, &quot;No.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:22</FONT>&nbsp; They said therefore to him, &quot;Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:23</FONT>&nbsp; He said, &quot;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' as Isaiah the prophet said.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:24</FONT>&nbsp;  The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:25</FONT>&nbsp; They asked him, &quot;Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:26</FONT>&nbsp; John answered them, &quot;I baptize in water, but among you stands one whom you don't know. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:27</FONT>&nbsp; He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:2</FONT>&nbsp; The same came to him by night, and said to him, &quot;Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:3</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered him, &quot;Most assuredly, I tell you, unless one is born anew, he can't see the Kingdom of God.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:5</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered, &quot;Most assuredly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can't enter into the Kingdom of God! <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:6</FONT>&nbsp; That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:8</FONT>&nbsp; The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don't know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:10</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered him, &quot;Are you the teacher of Israel, and don't understand these things? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:11</FONT>&nbsp; Most assuredly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don't receive our witness. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:13</FONT>&nbsp; No one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:15</FONT>&nbsp; that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:16</FONT>&nbsp; For God so loved the world, that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:17</FONT>&nbsp; For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:18</FONT>&nbsp; He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn't believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:19</FONT>&nbsp; This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:20</FONT>&nbsp; For everyone who does evil hates the light, and doesn't come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>3:21</FONT>&nbsp; But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.&quot; <BR>
