<A HREF="c13i.html">Section 13:</A>
The Passion of Jesus </B>(Passover 30 - Thursday night and Friday)
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Jesus and the apostles cross the city towards the garden of Gethsemane,
outside Jerusalem (Thursday night).
Peter, James and John witness 
<A HREF="#ss01">the agony of Jesus</A>,
who prays to the Father and is comforted by an angel.
Soon Judas arrives with the soldiers;
<A HREF="#ss02">Jesus is arrested</A>
and the disciples forsake him.
<BR>
The <I>ecclesiastical trial </I>begins: at first he is led
<A HREF="#ss08">to Annas</A>,
who sends him 
<A HREF="#ss11">to Caiphas</A>
(after midnight).
It follows a first examination
<A HREF="#ss12">before Caiphas and the priests of the Sanhedrin</A>,
when
<A HREF="#ss14">Jesus confesses and is condemned</A>.
<A HREF="#ss15">Peter denies him</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss16">Jesus is mocked and beat</A> by the Jews.
About dawn (Friday)
<A HREF="#ss17">the Sanedrin meets and ratifies Jesus' condemnation</A>;
he is sent
<A HREF="#ss18">to Pilatus</A>.
 Meanwhile
<A HREF="#ss19">Judas repents, despairs and dies</A>.
<BR>
It begins then the <I>civil trial </I>,
<A HREF="#ss20">before Pilatus</A>.
After a
<A HREF="#ss21">first examination</A>,
 he sends him 
<A HREF="#ss23">to Herod Antipas</A>.
Jesus keeps silent, is mocked by Herod
and sent back to Pilatus dressed in purple.
<A HREF="#ss24">Pilatus declares him innocent</A>
but, in order to please the jewish priests,
he let the people choose between
<A HREF="#ss26">Jesus and Barabbas</A>;
 the people prefers
<A HREF="#ss27">Barabbas' liberation.</A>
Jesus is
<A HREF="#ss28">flogged</A>,
<A HREF="#ss29">crowned with thorns</A>
and exposed to the people:
<A HREF="#ss30">"Ecce homo!"</A>;
the Jews insist on requesting his death.
<A HREF="#ss31">Pilatus examines Jesus again</A>
brings him out to the Jews, and wash his hands;
finally, he reluctantly sentences him to be crucified.
<BR>
(Friday morning) On the way 
<A HREF="#ss33">to the Golgotha carrying the cross</A>,
 Jesus is helped by Simon of Cirene; he speaks to 
<A HREF="#ss34">the mourning women</A>.
He is
<A HREF="#ss35">crucified</A>,
 between 
<A HREF="#ss36">the two robbers</A>.
 The soldiers
<A HREF="#ss39">divide his clothing</A>,
 the passing people blasphem and mock at him:
<A HREF="#ss40">"Save yourself, if you are the Son of God!"</A>.
He pronounces the last <I>Seven words:</I>
<A HREF="#ss38">1: "Father, forgive them..."</A>,

<A HREF="#ss41">2: "Today you will be with me in paradise"</A>,

<A HREF="#ss42">3: "Woman, behold your son..."</A>,

<A HREF="#ss44">4: "... why have you forsaken me? "</A>,

<A HREF="#ss45">5: "I am thirsty..."</A>,
<A HREF="#ss46">6: "It is finished"</A>,

<A HREF="#ss47">7: "Father, into your hands...".</A>.
About noon, 
<A HREF="#ss48">Jesus dies</A>,
 the sun is darkened and the veil of the temple is torn in two.
<BR>
After a soldier pierces his side,
he is
<A HREF="#ss52">taken down from the cross and buried</A>
by Joseph of Arimatea (Friday afternoon).
<BR>
On the Sabbath day, while the women prepare
<A HREF="#ss53">the ointments</A>,
 the pharisee place
<A HREF="#ss54">a guard at the door of the tomb</A>.
