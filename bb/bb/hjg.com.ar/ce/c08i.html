<A HREF="c08i.html">Section 8:</A>
To the Feast of Tabernacles, in Jerusalem </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sep 29 - Oct 29)
<BR>
Jesus leaves Galilee, and begins a 
<A HREF="#ss02">private journey to Jerusalem</A>,
to attend the Feast of Tabernacles.
As 
<A HREF="#ss03">the Samaritans refuse him hospitality</A>,
he must deviate his way through Perea, on the east side of the Jordan
(Sept 29).
During this trip, Jesus tells the
<A HREF="#ss04">requirements for following him</A>,
he
<A HREF="#ss05">sends out the seventy-two disciples</A>
and he
<A HREF="#ss06">rebukes the impenitent cities</A>.
At the time of the 
<A HREF="#ss07">joyful return of the disciples</A>,
<A HREF="#ss08">Jesus rejoices and blesses the Father</A>
for having revealed to the children.
He invites to take his yoke
<A HREF="#ss09">("my yoke is light...")</A>
 and he proclaims
<A HREF="#ss10">blessed the eyes that see these things</A>.
Entering Judea, he relates the
<A HREF="#ss11">parable of the good Samaritan</A>.
 He is received
<A HREF="#ss12">in Bethany, in the home of Mary and Martha</A>,
where he declares that "Mary has chosen the good part".
<BR>
<A HREF="#ss13">In Jerusalem, in the feast of the Tabernacles</A>
(Oct 29), he maintains several 
<A HREF="#ss14">discussions with the Jews</A>
and he claims:
<A HREF="#ss17">"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!"</A>.
They asked him about
<A HREF="#ss19">the case of the adulterous woman</A>, 
and he sentences: "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her".
<A HREF="#ss20">The disputes with the pharisees continue</A>;
Jesus claims to be 
<A HREF="#ss21">the light of the world</A>
and ends the discussion with the astonishing sentence:
<A HREF="#ss24">"before Abraham existed, I am"</A>,
that leads the Jews to anger and scandal.
<BR>
Then he
<A HREF="#ss25">cures a man born blind</A> on the Sabbath day
and the pharisees
<A HREF="#ss27">examine the cured man and his parents</A>.
Jesus proclaims himself as 
<A HREF="#ss29">the good shepherd</A>
who lays down his life for the sheep.
He finishes this stay in Jerusalem with
<A HREF="#ss31">the parable of the persistent friend</A>
(Oct 29).

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:3</FONT>&nbsp; His brothers therefore said to him, &quot;Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:4</FONT>&nbsp; For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:5</FONT>&nbsp; For even his brothers didn't believe in him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:6</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus therefore said to them, &quot;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:7</FONT>&nbsp; The world can't hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:9</FONT>&nbsp;  Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:10</FONT>&nbsp; But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:11</FONT>&nbsp; The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, &quot;Where is he?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:12</FONT>&nbsp; There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, &quot;He is a good man.&quot; Others said, &quot;Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:13</FONT>&nbsp; Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. <A HREF="c08i.html#ss14"><IMG SRC="img/nv.gif" BORDER=0></A><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:53</FONT>&nbsp; They didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face set towards Jerusalem. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:54</FONT>&nbsp; When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, &quot;Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky, and destroy them, just as Elijah did?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:55</FONT>&nbsp; But he turned and rebuked them, &quot;You don't know of what kind of spirit you are. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:56</FONT>&nbsp; For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.&quot; They went to another village. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:27</FONT>&nbsp; He answered, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:30</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered, &quot;A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:33</FONT>&nbsp; But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:34</FONT>&nbsp; came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:35</FONT>&nbsp; On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:36</FONT>&nbsp; Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:32</FONT>&nbsp; You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:33</FONT>&nbsp; They answered him, &quot;We are Abraham's seed, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, 'You will be made free?'&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:34</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &quot;Most assuredly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:35</FONT>&nbsp; A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever. A son remains forever. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:36</FONT>&nbsp; If therefore the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:37</FONT>&nbsp; I know that you are Abraham's seed, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:38</FONT>&nbsp; I say the things which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:39</FONT>&nbsp; They answered him, &quot;Our father is Abraham.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:40</FONT>&nbsp; But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham didn't do this. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:41</FONT>&nbsp; You do the works of your father.&quot; They said to him, &quot;We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one Father, God.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:42</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore Jesus said to them, &quot;If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:43</FONT>&nbsp; Why don't you understand my speech? Because you can't hear my word. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:44</FONT>&nbsp; You are of your Father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:45</FONT>&nbsp; But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:46</FONT>&nbsp; Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:47</FONT>&nbsp; He who is of God hears the words of God. For this cause you don't hear, because you are not of God.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:49</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered, &quot;I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:50</FONT>&nbsp; But I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:51</FONT>&nbsp; Most assuredly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:52</FONT>&nbsp; Then the Jews said to him, &quot;Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:53</FONT>&nbsp; Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:54</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered, &quot;If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:55</FONT>&nbsp; You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, 'I don't know him,' I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and keep his word. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:56</FONT>&nbsp; Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day. He saw it, and was glad.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:57</FONT>&nbsp; The Jews therefore said to him, &quot;You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:2</FONT>&nbsp; His disciples asked him, &quot;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:3</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered, &quot;Neither did this man sin, nor his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:4</FONT>&nbsp; I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:6</FONT>&nbsp; When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud, <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:8</FONT>&nbsp; The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, &quot;Isn't this he who sat and begged?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:9</FONT>&nbsp; Others were saying, &quot;It is he.&quot; Still others were saying, &quot;He looks like him.&quot; He said, &quot;I am he.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:11</FONT>&nbsp; He answered, &quot;A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash.' So I went away and washed, and I received sight.&quot; <BR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=#F0F0e9><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:13</FONT>&nbsp;  They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:14</FONT>&nbsp; It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:15</FONT>&nbsp; Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, &quot;He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:16</FONT>&nbsp; Some therefore of the Pharisees said, &quot;This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath.&quot; Others said, &quot;How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?&quot; There was division among them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:17</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore they asked the blind man again, &quot;What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?&quot; He said, &quot;He is a prophet.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:18</FONT>&nbsp; The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:19</FONT>&nbsp; and asked them, &quot;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:20</FONT>&nbsp; His parents answered them, &quot;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:21</FONT>&nbsp; but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:22</FONT>&nbsp; His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:23</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore his parents said, &quot;He is of age. Ask him.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:24</FONT>&nbsp; So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, &quot;Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:25</FONT>&nbsp; He therefore answered, &quot;I don't know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:26</FONT>&nbsp; They said to him again, &quot;What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:27</FONT>&nbsp; He answered them, &quot;I told you already, and you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't also want to become his disciples, do you?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:28</FONT>&nbsp; They insulted him and said, &quot;You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:29</FONT>&nbsp; We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don't know where he comes from.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:30</FONT>&nbsp; The man answered them, &quot;How amazing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:31</FONT>&nbsp; We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:32</FONT>&nbsp; Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:33</FONT>&nbsp; If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:34</FONT>&nbsp; They answered him, &quot;You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?&quot; They threw him out. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:2</FONT>&nbsp; But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:3</FONT>&nbsp; The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:4</FONT>&nbsp; Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:5</FONT>&nbsp; They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don't know the voice of strangers.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:8</FONT>&nbsp; All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:9</FONT>&nbsp; I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:10</FONT>&nbsp; The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:11</FONT>&nbsp; I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:12</FONT>&nbsp; He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:13</FONT>&nbsp; The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:14</FONT>&nbsp; I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:15</FONT>&nbsp; even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:16</FONT>&nbsp; I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. <BR>
