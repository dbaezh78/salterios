 Birth of Jesus. Childhood and hidden life</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(6BC - 8AD)
<BR>
After the
<A HREF="#ss01"></A>
prefaces of the evangelists
<A HREF="#ss02">Luke</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss03">John</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss04">annunciation of the birth of John the Baptist</A>
(Jerusalem 6BC), the history of our salvation begins with the
<A HREF="#ss05">annunciation from the angel to Mary</A>, 
who gives her consent to the incarnation of the Verb (Nazareth, March 5BC).
<A HREF="#ss06">Mary visits Elizabeth <I>(Magnificat)</I></A>
(Judea, April 5BC) and a few months later 
<A HREF="#ss07">John the Baptist is born <I>(Benedictus)</I></A>
(Judea, June 5BC).
<BR>
The evangelists tell
<A HREF="#ss08">the genealogies of Jesus</A>.
<BR>
An 
<A HREF="#ss09">angel appears to Joseph</A> in a dream;
Joseph takes Mary to live with him at Nazareth. 
Because of the census, they travel to Bethlehem, where 
<A HREF="#ss10">Jesus is born in the manger</A>
(Dec 5BC).
 The child receives the
<A HREF="#ss11">adoration of the shepherds</A>
and eight days later he is taken to Jerusalem for his
<A HREF="#ss12">circumcision</A>.
<BR>
The Holy Family return to Jerusalem for the
<A HREF="#ss13">presentation in the temple</A>, where 
Simeon prophesies (Feb 4BC).
Coming back to Bethlehem, they receive the visit of
<A HREF="#ss14">the Magi from the East</A>
and later, aware of the persecution of Herod, they 
<A HREF="#ss15">escape to Egypt</A>.
Herod orders then the
<A HREF="#ss16">slaughter of the innocents</A>
(Jerusalem, Dec 4BC).
<BR>
After Herod's death, the Holy Family
<A HREF="#ss17">returns from Egypt</A>
(Oct 2AD) and they finally settle
<A HREF="#ss18">in Nazareth.</A>
 In a trip to Jerusalem,
<A HREF="#ss19">the child is lost and found in the temple</A>
(Mar 7AD).
During the next years 
<A HREF="#ss20">Jesus lives silently in Nazareth</A>, with Mary and Joseph.

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:2</FONT>&nbsp;  The same was in the beginning with God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:3</FONT>&nbsp; All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:4</FONT>&nbsp; In him was life, and the life was the light of men. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:5</FONT>&nbsp; The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't overcome it. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:6</FONT>&nbsp; There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:7</FONT>&nbsp; The same came as a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe through him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:8</FONT>&nbsp; He was not the light, but was sent that he might testify about the light. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:9</FONT>&nbsp; The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:10</FONT>&nbsp; He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world didn't recognize him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:11</FONT>&nbsp; He came to his own, and those who were his own didn't receive him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:12</FONT>&nbsp; But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become God's children, to those who believe in his name: <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:13</FONT>&nbsp; who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:14</FONT>&nbsp; The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:15</FONT>&nbsp; John testified about him. He cried out, saying, &quot;This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.'&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:16</FONT>&nbsp;  From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:17</FONT>&nbsp; For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:18</FONT>&nbsp; No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him. <A HREF="c02i.html#ss08"><IMG SRC="img/nv.gif" BORDER=0></A><BR>

He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:6</FONT>&nbsp; They were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:7</FONT>&nbsp; But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:8</FONT>&nbsp; Now it happened, while he executed the priest's office before God in the order of his division, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:9</FONT>&nbsp; according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:10</FONT>&nbsp; The whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:11</FONT>&nbsp; An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:12</FONT>&nbsp; Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:13</FONT>&nbsp; But the angel said to him, &quot;Don't be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been heard, and your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:14</FONT>&nbsp; You will have joy and gladness; and many will rejoice at his birth. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:15</FONT>&nbsp; For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:16</FONT>&nbsp; He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord, their God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:17</FONT>&nbsp; He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:18</FONT>&nbsp; Zacharias said to the angel, &quot;How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:19</FONT>&nbsp; The angel answered him, &quot;I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:20</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will happen, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:21</FONT>&nbsp; The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:22</FONT>&nbsp; When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:23</FONT>&nbsp; It happened, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he departed to his house. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:24</FONT>&nbsp; After these days Elizabeth, his wife, conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:25</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Thus has the Lord done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my reproach among men.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:27</FONT>&nbsp; to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:28</FONT>&nbsp; Having come in, the angel said to her, &quot;Rejoice, you highly favored one! The Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women!&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:29</FONT>&nbsp; But when she saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what kind of salutation this might be. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:30</FONT>&nbsp; The angel said to her, &quot;Don't be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:31</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name 'Jesus.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:32</FONT>&nbsp; He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:33</FONT>&nbsp; and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his kingdom.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:34</FONT>&nbsp; Mary said to the angel, &quot;How can this be, seeing I am a virgin?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>1:35</FONT>&nbsp; The angel answered her, &quot;The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born from you will be called the Son of God. <BR>
