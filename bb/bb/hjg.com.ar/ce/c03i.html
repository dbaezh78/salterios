First mission in Galilee</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Dec 27 - Mar 28)
<BR>
<A HREF="#ss01">In Samaria</A>, while travelling
from Judea to Galilee,
<A HREF="#ss02">Jesus speaks to the Samaritan woman</A> at the well of Sychar
(Dec 27), and after then he stays two days
<A HREF="#ss04">preaching to the Samaritans</A>.
<BR>
Thereafter
<A HREF="#ss05">Jesus begins his first mission at Galilee</A>
(Jan 28).<BR>
In Cana, he
<A HREF="#ss06">heals the son of the official of Capernaum</A>.
 In Nazareth he
<A HREF="#ss07">teaches in the synagogue</A>
and the people try to kill him; he settles down then
<A HREF="#ss08">at Capernaum</A>.
 Near the Sea of Galilee, he calls the fishermen
<A HREF="#ss09">to fish for people</A>
(Jan 28).
At Capernaum, Jesus astounds
the people with his teachings and 
his <A HREF="#ss10">numerous healings</A>.
 Then he extends his mission
<A HREF="#ss14">to all Galilee</A>.
 At the Sea of Galilee, after 
<A HREF="#ss16">preaching from Peter's boat</A>,
he performs 
<A HREF="#ss17">the miraculous fishing.</A>
 Then follow
<A HREF="#ss18">more cures</A>: 
(<A HREF="#ss19">a leper</A>,
<A HREF="#ss20">a paralytic</A>) and the
<A HREF="#ss21">call to Matthew</A> at Capernaum (Mar 28).
<BR>
He is questioned because his disciples don't fast, but Jesus justifies them:
<A HREF="#ss22">"New wines in new wineskins"</A>.

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:2</FONT>&nbsp; (although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples), <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:3</FONT>&nbsp; he left Judea, and departed into Galilee. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:4</FONT>&nbsp; He needed to pass through Samaria. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:5</FONT>&nbsp; So he came to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son, Joseph. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:6</FONT>&nbsp; Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:7</FONT>&nbsp; A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, &quot;Give me a drink.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:8</FONT>&nbsp; For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:9</FONT>&nbsp; The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, &quot;How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?&quot; (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:10</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered her, &quot;If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:11</FONT>&nbsp; The woman said to him, &quot;Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. From where then have you that living water? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:12</FONT>&nbsp; Are you greater than our father, Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as did his children, and his cattle?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:13</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered her, &quot;Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:14</FONT>&nbsp; but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:15</FONT>&nbsp; The woman said to him, &quot;Sir, give me this water, so that I don't get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:16</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to her, &quot;Go, call your husband, and come here.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:17</FONT>&nbsp; The woman answered, &quot;I have no husband.&quot; Jesus said to her, &quot;You said well, 'I have no husband,' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:18</FONT>&nbsp; for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:19</FONT>&nbsp; The woman said to him, &quot;Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:20</FONT>&nbsp; Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:21</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to her, &quot;Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:22</FONT>&nbsp; You worship that which you don't know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:23</FONT>&nbsp; But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshippers. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:24</FONT>&nbsp; God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:25</FONT>&nbsp; The woman said to him, &quot;I know that Messiah comes,&quot; (he who is called Christ). &quot;When he has come, he will declare to us all things.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:26</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to her, &quot;I am he, the one who speaks to you.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:28</FONT>&nbsp; So the woman left her water pot, and went away into the city, and said to the people, <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:31</FONT>&nbsp; In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, &quot;Rabbi, eat.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:32</FONT>&nbsp; But he said to them, &quot;I have food to eat that you don't know about.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:33</FONT>&nbsp; The disciples therefore said one to another, &quot;Has anyone brought him something to eat?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:34</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to them, &quot;My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:35</FONT>&nbsp; Don't you say, 'There are yet four months until the harvest?' Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:36</FONT>&nbsp; He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:37</FONT>&nbsp; For in this the saying is true, 'One sows, and another reaps.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:38</FONT>&nbsp; I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:17</FONT>&nbsp; The book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was written, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:18</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;The Spirit of the Lord is on me, Because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, To proclaim release to the captives, Recovering of sight to the blind, To deliver those who are crushed, <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:24</FONT>&nbsp; He said, &quot;Most assuredly I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:25</FONT>&nbsp; But truly I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:26</FONT>&nbsp; Elijah was sent to none of them, except to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:27</FONT>&nbsp; There were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except Naaman, the Syrian.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:28</FONT>&nbsp; They were all filled with wrath in the synagogue, as they heard these things. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:29</FONT>&nbsp; They rose up, threw him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that they might throw him off the cliff. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:7</FONT>&nbsp;  He arose and departed to his house. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:8</FONT>&nbsp; But when the multitudes saw it, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:2</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:3</FONT>&nbsp; Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:4</FONT>&nbsp; When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:5</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, &quot;Son, your sins are forgiven you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:6</FONT>&nbsp; But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:7</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:8</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, &quot;Why do you reason these things in your hearts? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:9</FONT>&nbsp; Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven;' or to say, 'Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?' <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>2:12</FONT>&nbsp; He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, &quot;We never saw anything like this!&quot; <BR>

The power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:18</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, men brought a paralyzed man on a cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:19</FONT>&nbsp; Not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:20</FONT>&nbsp; Seeing their faith, he said to him, &quot;Man, your sins are forgiven you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:21</FONT>&nbsp; The scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, &quot;Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:22</FONT>&nbsp; But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, &quot;Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:23</FONT>&nbsp; Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?' <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:25</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately he rose up before them, and took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house, glorifying God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:26</FONT>&nbsp; Amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God. They were filled with fear, saying, &quot;We have seen strange things today.&quot; <BR>
