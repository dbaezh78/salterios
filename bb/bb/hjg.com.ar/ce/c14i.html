 Resurrection, appearances and ascension </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sunday of Glory - May 30)
<BR>
The women bring ointments to sepulchre (Sunday, very early),
but they find
<A HREF="#ss03">the grave empty</A>.
 While
<A HREF="#ss04">Mary Magdalen runs to tell Peter</A>,

<A HREF="#ss05">an angel appears to the other women</A>
and tells them that Jesus has risen.
<A HREF="#ss07">Peter and John hasten to the tomb</A>
and inspect it.
 Meanwhile,
<A HREF="#ss08">Jesus appears to Mary Magdalen</A>
that had been weeping outside <I>(noli me tangere)</I>.
The same day, he appears to other women, to Peter and to 
<A HREF="#ss10">the disciples of Emmaus</A>,
who return to Jerusalem to bring the news.
Finally, that afternoon, 
<A HREF="#ss12">Jesus appears to the apostles</A>
in a close room, and eats with them.
<BR>
Eight days later it happens a
<A HREF="#ss13">new appearance</A>,
 and Thomas at last believes.
 In another
<A HREF="#ss14">appearance in the sea of Tiberias</A>
to seven pupils, he
<A HREF="#ss15">talks with Pedro and confirms his primacy</A>. 
After another
<A HREF="#ss17">appearance on a mountain in Galilee</A>,
 and forty days after his resurrection, 
<A HREF="#ss18">Jesus parts from the disciples</A>:
on the Mount of Olivet (between Jerusalem and Bethany)
<A HREF="#ss19">he ascends into heaven</A>.
<BR>
It follows then the
<A HREF="#ss20">joyful return of the disciples</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss21">beginning of the great mission</A>.
<BR>
<A HREF="#ss22">John ends his gospel</A>
declaring:
<FONT COLOR=#336600">
"Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not
written in this book; but these are written, that 
<B>
you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that
 believing you may have life in his name"

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:18</FONT>&nbsp; One of them, named Cleopas, answered him, &quot;Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn't know the things which have happened there in these days?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:19</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;What things?&quot; They said to him, &quot;The things concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:20</FONT>&nbsp; and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:21</FONT>&nbsp; But we were hoping that it was he who would redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:22</FONT>&nbsp; Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:23</FONT>&nbsp; and when they didn't find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:24</FONT>&nbsp; Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn't see him.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:25</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:26</FONT>&nbsp; Didn't the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:27</FONT>&nbsp; Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:28</FONT>&nbsp; They drew near to the village, where they were going, and he acted like he would go further. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:29</FONT>&nbsp; They urged him, saying, &quot;Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.&quot; He went in to stay with them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:30</FONT>&nbsp; It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks. Breaking it, he gave to them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:31</FONT>&nbsp; Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>24:32</FONT>&nbsp; They said one to another, &quot;Weren't our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>21:2</FONT>&nbsp; Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>21:7</FONT>&nbsp; That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, &quot;It's the Lord!&quot; So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat around him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>21:8</FONT>&nbsp; But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away), dragging the net full of fish. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>21:9</FONT>&nbsp; So when they got out on the land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>21:12</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to them, &quot;Come and eat breakfast.&quot; None of the disciples dared inquire of him, &quot;Who are you?&quot; knowing that it was the Lord. <BR>
