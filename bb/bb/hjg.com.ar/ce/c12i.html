The Last Supper </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Passover 30: Thursday)
<BR> Jesus sends the disciples 
<A HREF="#ss01">to prepare for Passover</A>;
he and the twelve meet in a guest room, at Jerusalem, to eat	
<A HREF="#ss02"><I>the Last Supper.</I></A>
(Thursday evening).
<BR> He begins by 
<A HREF="#ss05">washing the apostles' feet</A>,
he
<A HREF="#ss07">predicts his betrayal</A>
and Judas goes out.
The disciples contend about their supremacy, and Jesus
<A HREF="#ss10">exhorts them to humility</A>.
Then he 
<A HREF="#ss11">institutes the Holy Eucharist</A>.
He gives them 
<A HREF="#ss12">the New Commandment</A>:
"that you love one another, just like I have loved you",
and he 
<A HREF="#ss13">predicts Peter's denial</A>.
<BR>
It follows then
<A HREF="#ss15">the Farewell discourse</A>:
to enlighten the hearts of the disciples, he recalls the eternal mansions
<A HREF="#ss16">("I am the way, the truth, and the life")</A>,
, the relief for the present life: 
<A HREF="#ss17">"Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you"</A>
and compares himself with 
<A HREF="#ss18">the vine that sustains the branches ("He who remains in me  bears much fruit")</A>;
he reminds them 
<A HREF="#ss19">the commandment of love</A>
and predicts to them the hate of the world; he promises them
<A HREF="#ss20">the relief of the Counselor</A>,
<A HREF="#ss21">the eternal joy ("no one will take your joy away")</A>
and ends exhorting to courage
<A HREF="#ss22">"In the world you have oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world")</A>.
<BR>
It follows
<A HREF="#ss23">the intercessory prayer</A>,
 in which Jesus prays to the Father 
<A HREF="#ss24">for himself</A>,
<A HREF="#ss25">for the Apostles</A> and
<A HREF="#ss26">for the Church.

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:23</FONT>&nbsp; One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus' breast. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:24</FONT>&nbsp; Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, &quot;Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:26</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus therefore answered, &quot;It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.&quot; So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:27</FONT>&nbsp; After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, &quot;What you do, do quickly.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:28</FONT>&nbsp; Now no man at the table knew why he said this to him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:29</FONT>&nbsp; For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, &quot;Buy what things we need for the feast,&quot; or that he should give something to the poor. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>13:30</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore, having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:2</FONT>&nbsp; They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:4</FONT>&nbsp; But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn't tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:5</FONT>&nbsp; But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?' <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:7</FONT>&nbsp; Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don't go away, the Counselor won't come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:8</FONT>&nbsp; When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:9</FONT>&nbsp; about sin, because they don't believe in me; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:10</FONT>&nbsp; about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won't see me any more; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:11</FONT>&nbsp; about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:12</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;I have yet many things to tell you, but you can't bear them now. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:13</FONT>&nbsp; However when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:14</FONT>&nbsp; He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:15</FONT>&nbsp; All things whatever the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine, and will declare it to you. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>16:20</FONT>&nbsp; Most assuredly I tell you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. <BR>
