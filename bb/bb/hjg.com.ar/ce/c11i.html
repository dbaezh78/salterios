Triumphal entry into Jerusalem: Beginning of the Passion Week</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Passover 30: from Palm Sunday to Wednesday)
<BR>
On the Sunday before Passover (Palms Sunday) Jesus 
<A HREF="#ss01">enters triumphantly into Jerusalem</A>
sitting on a donkey, among the acclamations of the crowds.
For the second time, 
<A HREF="#ss02">he drives out the merchants from the temple</A>
; the priests ask him to rebuke the people, and Jesus answers:
<A HREF="#ss04">"if these were silent, the stones would cry out!"</A>.
 At dusk, he 
<A HREF="#ss05">comes back to Bethany</A>, to  Lazarus' home.
<BR>
Next  day (Monday) he 
<A HREF="#ss06">returns to Jerusalem</A>
; during this excursion, he
<A HREF="#ss07">curses the barren fig tree</A>
and thereafter he again
<A HREF="#ss08">comes back to Bethany</A>.
<BR>
In the next morning  (Tuesday) they find
<A HREF="#ss09">the withered fig</A>.
 In the temple of Jerusalem he
<A HREF="#ss11">teaches and disputes with the priests</A>.
 He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="#ss13">the two sons</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss14">parable of the wicked farmers</A>.
The pharisees and sadducees ask him about several questions:
<A HREF="#ss16">Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar?</A>, 
<A HREF="#ss17">Will the dead resurrect?</A>,
<A HREF="#ss18">Which is the First Commandment?</A>.
Before the hostility of the pharisees, Jesus pronounces his last and harsh
<A HREF="#ss20">recrimination against the pharisees: ("Hypocrites! whitened tombs!")</A>
<BR>
After the episode of
<A HREF="#ss21">the widow's mite</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss22">petition of the Greeks to see Jesus</A>, 
he again 
<A HREF="#ss23">announces his Passion ("unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies...")</A>
and a voice is heard from the sky.
<BR>
Afterwards Jesus pronounces 
<A HREF="#ss25">the Eschatological Discourse</A>,
 about the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the world and Christ's return with glory.
He keeps
<A HREF="#ss36">preaching in the temple</A>,
 and tells the
<A HREF="#ss37">parable of the ten virgins</A>,
 the
<A HREF="#ss38">parable of the talents</A>
and warns about the 
<A HREF="#ss39">Final Judgement ("I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat..."</A>.
<BR>
<A HREF="#ss40">The chief priests plan to kill him</A>;
the next day (Wednesday)
<A HREF="#ss41">Judas consents to betray Jesus</A>
and they promise to give him thirty pieces of silver.

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>20:34</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to them, &quot;The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>20:35</FONT>&nbsp; But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>20:36</FONT>&nbsp; For they can't die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>12:33</FONT>&nbsp; and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>12:34</FONT>&nbsp; When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, &quot;You are not far from the Kingdom of God.&quot; No one dared ask him any question after that. <BR>
