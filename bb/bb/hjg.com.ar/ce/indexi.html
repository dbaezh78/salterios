<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a complete <I>&quot;Harmony of the Gospels&quot;</I>, including
the full texts of the four Gospels, in parallel and cronologically
arranged.
The geography of the events is also indicated.
<P>
Similar tasks were already undertaken
in the first centuries of the christian age
(Tatian, about A.D.160; Ammonious of Alexandria, A.D. 220);
the motivation came mainly from the <I>parallel places</I> found in the synoptic gospels.
This harmony is based on that published by P. Leonardo Castellani, in his book
<A HREF="../txt/lc/index-2.html">El Evangelio de Jesucristo</A>,
which was itself based on many other previous works.

<P>I have adopted the following fundamental dates:
<UL>
<LI><B>Birth of Jesus: </B> End of the year <B>5 BC</B>
<LI><B>Beginning of his public life:</B> End of the year <B>26 AD</B>
<LI><B>Death and resurrection:</B> Passover (March or April) year <B>30 AD</B>
</UL>
This dates should be taken as approximate; the majority of the scholars
diverge in no more than two years. The precision is better for some
intervals of time: for example, the duration of the public life
of Christ (tree years plus some months, covering four PAssovers)
is regarded as very probable.
<BR>
Hence, when an event is dated with month and year
(eg: Jan 29), the date should be understood as merely possible;
it's just a mean to ease the following of the chronology.
Also the order (and the identification) of the events,
and the pathways in the maps are only probable.
<BR>
Further, in this harmony, each verse of each gospel appears once.
This implies some arbitrariness, as some texts may belong
to more than one places: surely Jesus
repeated some of his teachings on distinct occasions.
<P>
To ease the presentation, I have divided the life of Christ into
<B>14 sections</B>;
an index and summary of all sections can be found
<A HREF=resumi.html>here</A>.
Also included is a page that resumes the
<A HREF=geoi.html>geographical and historical facts</A>.
<P>
The texts of the New testament were taken from the
<I>World English Bible</I>,
<A HREF="http://ebible.org/bible/web">http://ebible.org/bible/web</A>.
<P>

<P>
Regarding the navigation of this harmony, two things should be noticed:
<UL>
<LI> The texts of each gospel are <I>chained</I> by small black arrows,
that permit to follow each gospel when the text in the harmony
has a jump or interruption ... (it's easier to understand it by trying
it).
<LI>
It's highly recommended to use the browser at full screen and high resolution
<SMALL>(1024 x 768 pixels, 16 bits color, or more)</SMALL>.
Also, remember that the browser permits you to change the font size.
</UL>
<P>
If you are interested in this work, you may prefer to copy it to
your computer, to browse it offline.
You can mail me at

and I'll send you a copy to install (free, of course).
Also, comments, corrections and suggestions are welcomed.
<P>
This harmony was done with the only purpose of increasing our knowledge
of the life of Jesus, and the devotion to our Lord and Savior.
