<A HREF="c07i.html">Section 7:</A>
 The long trip. The transfiguration </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(May 29 - Aug 29)
<BR>
Avoiding Herod's territories, Jesus undertakes a long missionary trip.
In the region of Tyre and Sidon, he consents to the request of 
<A HREF="#ss02">the cananite woman: ("Even the dogs eat the crumbs...")</A>
 (May 29).
At Decapolis, he
<A HREF="#ss03">cures a deaf man</A>.
Returning to Galilee, he
<A HREF="#ss04">cures many sick people</A>
and performs the
<A HREF="#ss05">second miracle of the loaves</A>, 
feeding 4000 men.
The 
<A HREF="#ss06">pharisees ask him for a sign</A>:
Jesus answers predicting the sign of Jonah. Jesus prevents their disciples against
<A HREF="#ss07">the yeast of the pharisees</A>.
In Bethsaida, he
<A HREF="#ss08">cures a blind man</A>
(Jun 29) and they continue their way towards the north.
Approaching Caesarea Philippi
<A HREF="#ss09">Peter confesses his faith in Christ, the Son of God</A>
and he receives the promise of the keys; Jesus then 
<A HREF="#ss10">predicts his Passion</A>
and Peter is rebuked for refusing to accept it.
Days later, it happens
<A HREF="#ss12">the Transfiguration of Jesus</A>
on the mountain, before Peter, James and John (Jul 29).
<BR>
Coming down, Jesus
<A HREF="#ss14">cures a boy ("I believe; help my unbelief!")</A>.
Returning to Capernaum, he 
<A HREF="#ss15">predicts his death and resurrection</A> 
again, and he consents to
<A HREF="#ss16">pay the tax</A>.
He exhorts to the spiritual childhood and condemns
<A HREF="#ss17">those who put stumbling blocks</A>
(Ago 29). He explains the necessity of
<A HREF="#ss18">correcting and forgiving fraternally</A>
and ends with the
<A HREF="#ss19">parable of the merciless servant</A>.

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:22</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, &quot;Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:23</FONT>&nbsp; But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, &quot;Send her away; for she cries after us.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:26</FONT>&nbsp; But he answered, &quot;It is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:27</FONT>&nbsp; But she said, &quot;Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:28</FONT>&nbsp; Then Jesus answered her, &quot;Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.&quot; And her daughter was healed from that hour. <A HREF="c07i.html#ss04"><IMG SRC="img/nv.gif" BORDER=0></A><BR>

He entered into a house, and didn't want anyone to know it, but he couldn't escape notice. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:25</FONT>&nbsp; For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:26</FONT>&nbsp; Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:27</FONT>&nbsp; But Jesus said to her, &quot;Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>18:7</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes! <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>18:8</FONT>&nbsp; If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>18:9</FONT>&nbsp; If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>18:10</FONT>&nbsp; See that you don't despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. <BR>
