<A HREF="c06i.html">Section 6:</A>
 Miracles and prodigies. The mission of the disciples </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sep 28 - Apr 29)
<BR>
Jesus retires away from the people, 
crosses the lake with his disciples and 
<A HREF="#ss01">calms the winds and the waves</A>
(Sep 28).
 He disembarks in Gerasa and
<A HREF="#ss02">expels the demons of a possessed man</A>;
the demons enter into the swine and the villagers get afraid of Jesus.
He returns then to Capernaum, where he heals the woman who had touched  
his clothes and 
<A HREF="#ss03">raises the daughter of Jairus</A> (Oct 28).
He is
<A HREF="#ss04">rejected in Nazareth</A>
("no one is prophet in his own country").
<BR>
<A HREF="#ss05">He sends the twelve</A> disciples
in their first missionary tour, two by two:
<A HREF="#ss06">"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few"</A>, 
while he starts 
<A HREF="#ss08">another missionary tour through Galilee</A>
(Nov 28).
<BR>
About this time
<A HREF="#ss09">Herod orders John's death</A>,
 at the request from Herodias' daughter.
Then
<A HREF="#ss11">the disciples return and meet with Jesus</A>
(Mar 29).
They cross the lake looking for solitude, but they find a crowd 
in Bethsaida; Jesus continues teaching and healing, and in the evening
he carries out
<A HREF="#ss12">the first miracle of the loaves</A>,
feeding 5000 men with five loaves and two fishes.
The people, enthusiastic, want to make him king; 
Jesus sends the disciples back to the boat, and he escapes to the mountain
to pray alone.
At dusk, he meet the disciples
<A HREF="#ss13">walking upon the waters</A>, 
while they fight against the strong wind. After Peter's 
frustrated intent of walking toward Jesus on the waters, 
Jesus arrives to the boat and the storms ceases.
He continues  
<A HREF="#ss14">healing in Genesareth</A>
and in Capernaum he exhorts the people to
<A HREF="#ss16">look for the real food</A>; he self-proclaims as
<A HREF="#ss17">the bread of life</A>, 
and the pharisees take offence when he says:
<A HREF="#ss18">"My flesh is true food and my blood true drink"</A>.
Coming the
<A HREF="#ss20">third Passover</A>, this time Jesus remains in Galilee.
Again,
<A HREF="#ss21">Jesus reproaches the pharisees</A>
for hanging on human traditions:
 because
<A HREF="#ss25">"it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man"</A>
(Apr 29).

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:37</FONT>&nbsp; There arose a great wind storm, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:38</FONT>&nbsp; He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, &quot;Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:39</FONT>&nbsp; He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, &quot;Peace! Be still!&quot; The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>4:40</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:23</FONT>&nbsp; But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous amounts of water. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:24</FONT>&nbsp; They came to him, and awoke him, saying, &quot;Master, master, we are dying!&quot; He awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and it was calm. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:25</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;Where is your faith?&quot; Being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, &quot;Who is this, then, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:29</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, they cried out, saying, &quot;What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:30</FONT>&nbsp; Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:31</FONT>&nbsp; The demons begged him, saying, &quot;If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:32</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;Go!&quot; They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:33</FONT>&nbsp; Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:2</FONT>&nbsp; When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:3</FONT>&nbsp; who had his dwelling in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:4</FONT>&nbsp; because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:5</FONT>&nbsp; Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:6</FONT>&nbsp; When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:7</FONT>&nbsp; and crying out with a loud voice, he said, &quot;What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don't torment me.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:8</FONT>&nbsp; For he said to him, &quot;Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:9</FONT>&nbsp; He asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; He said to him, &quot;My name is Legion, for we are many.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:10</FONT>&nbsp; He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:11</FONT>&nbsp; Now there was on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:12</FONT>&nbsp; All the demons begged him, saying, &quot;Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:13</FONT>&nbsp; At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:14</FONT>&nbsp; Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city and in the country. The people came to see what it was that had happened. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:15</FONT>&nbsp; They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:16</FONT>&nbsp; Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:17</FONT>&nbsp; They began to beg him to depart from their region. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:18</FONT>&nbsp; As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:19</FONT>&nbsp; He didn't allow him, but said to him, &quot;Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:20</FONT>&nbsp; He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. <BR>
</FONT></TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=#E0E0c0><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:26</FONT>&nbsp; They arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:27</FONT>&nbsp; When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:28</FONT>&nbsp; When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, &quot;What do I have to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torment me!&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:29</FONT>&nbsp; For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:30</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus asked him, &quot;What is your name?&quot; He said, &quot;Legion,&quot; for many demons had entered into him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:31</FONT>&nbsp; They begged him that he would not command them to go into the abyss. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:32</FONT>&nbsp; Now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged him that he would allow them to enter into those. He allowed them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:33</FONT>&nbsp; The demons came out from the man, and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake, and were drowned. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:34</FONT>&nbsp; When those who fed them saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:35</FONT>&nbsp; People went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:36</FONT>&nbsp; Those who saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:37</FONT>&nbsp; All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid. He entered into the boat, and returned. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:38</FONT>&nbsp; But the man from whom the demons had gone out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>8:39</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Return to your house, and declare what great things God has done for you.&quot; He went his way, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:19</FONT>&nbsp;  Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:20</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the tassels of his garment; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:21</FONT>&nbsp; for she said within herself, &quot;If I just touch his garment, I will be made well.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:23</FONT>&nbsp; When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:24</FONT>&nbsp; he said to them, &quot;Make room, because the girl isn't dead, but sleeping.&quot; They were ridiculing him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:25</FONT>&nbsp; But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>9:26</FONT>&nbsp; The report of this went out into all that land. <A HREF="c09i.html#ss02"><IMG SRC="img/nv.gif" BORDER=0></A><BR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=#F0F0e9><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:21</FONT>&nbsp; When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:22</FONT>&nbsp; Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:23</FONT>&nbsp; and begged him much, saying, &quot;My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:24</FONT>&nbsp; He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:25</FONT>&nbsp; A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:26</FONT>&nbsp; and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:27</FONT>&nbsp; having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:28</FONT>&nbsp; For she said, &quot;If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:29</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:30</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, &quot;Who touched my clothes?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:31</FONT>&nbsp; His disciples said to him, &quot;You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:32</FONT>&nbsp;  He looked around to see her who had done this thing. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:33</FONT>&nbsp; But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:34</FONT>&nbsp; He said to her, &quot;Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:35</FONT>&nbsp; While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler's house saying, &quot;Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:36</FONT>&nbsp; But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, &quot;Don't be afraid, only believe.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:37</FONT>&nbsp; He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:38</FONT>&nbsp; He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:39</FONT>&nbsp; When he had entered in, he said to them, &quot;Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.&quot; <BR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=#F0F0e9><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:60</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said, &quot;This is a hard saying! Who can listen to it?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:61</FONT>&nbsp; But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them, &quot;Does this cause you to stumble? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:62</FONT>&nbsp; Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:63</FONT>&nbsp; It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:64</FONT>&nbsp; But there are some of you who don't believe.&quot; For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe, and who it was who would betray him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:65</FONT>&nbsp; He said, &quot;For this cause have I said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:66</FONT>&nbsp; At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:67</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said therefore to the twelve, &quot;You don't also want to go away, do you?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:68</FONT>&nbsp; Simon Peter answered him, &quot;Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:69</FONT>&nbsp; We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:70</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &quot;Didn't I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>6:71</FONT>&nbsp; Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:3</FONT>&nbsp; He answered them, &quot;Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:4</FONT>&nbsp; For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:5</FONT>&nbsp; But you say, 'Whoever may tell his father or his mother, &quot;Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:6</FONT>&nbsp; he shall not honor his father or mother.' You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:7</FONT>&nbsp; You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>15:8</FONT>&nbsp; 'These people draw near to me with their mouth, And honor me with their lips; But their heart is far from me. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:2</FONT>&nbsp; Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:3</FONT>&nbsp; (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don't eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:4</FONT>&nbsp; They don't eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:5</FONT>&nbsp; The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, &quot;Why don't your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:6</FONT>&nbsp; He answered them, &quot;Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:7</FONT>&nbsp; But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:8</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men--the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:9</FONT>&nbsp; He said to them, &quot;Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:10</FONT>&nbsp; For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother;' and, 'He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:11</FONT>&nbsp; But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, &quot;Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;&quot;' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:12</FONT>&nbsp; then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>7:13</FONT>&nbsp; making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.&quot; <BR>
