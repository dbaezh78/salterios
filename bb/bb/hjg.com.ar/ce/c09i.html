Last Judean Ministry</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Nov 29 - Dec 29)
<BR>
Leaving Jerusalem to make a brief missionary journey through Judea (Nov 29), Jesus
<A HREF="#ss02">cures two blind men</A>
and 
<A HREF="#ss03">casts out a daemon from a mute man</A>.
This causes 
<A HREF="#ss04">the slanders from the pharisees</A>, and
<A HREF="#ss05">Jesus defends himself ("How can Satan cast out Satan?")</A>
 and speaks about 
<A HREF="#ss06">the unforgivable sin</A>
against the Spirit.
He notes 
<A HREF="#ss08">who is to be truly blessed and why</A>
and he announces
<A HREF="#ss09">the sign of Jonah</A>.
 After the discourse about
<A HREF="#ss10">the spiritual light</A>
it follows another
<A HREF="#ss11">severe recrimination against the scribes and pharisees ("you took away the key...")</A>
Jesus then teaches the disciples 
<A HREF="#ss13">how to endure the persecutions</A>.
After then he speaks against
<A HREF="#ss16">the covetousness</A>,
teaching 
<A HREF="#ss17">the parable of the foolish rich man</A>.
He exhorts to 
<A HREF="#ss20">preparedness and faithfulness</A>
and expresses his eagerness of his
<A HREF="#ss23">baptism of fire</A>.
He requests attention to watch 
<A HREF="#ss25">the signs of the times</A>
and he teaches the parable of
<A HREF="#ss27">the sterile fig</A>.
 On the Sabbath day, the heals 
<A HREF="#ss28">he woman who had a spirit of infirmity</A>
and he answers to the question whether 
<A HREF="#ss29">are they few who are saved?</A>.
<BR>
Warned about 
<A HREF="#ss30">the persecution of Herod</A>
(Dec 29), he states that a prophet must die in Jerusalem,
and returns there for the feast of Dedication.
Approaching the city, he
<A HREF="#ss31">weeps over Jerusalem
</A>
