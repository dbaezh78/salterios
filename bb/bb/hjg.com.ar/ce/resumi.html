<BR>
After the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss01"></A>
prefaces of the evangelists
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss02">Luke</A>
and
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss03">John</A>
and the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss04">annunciation of the birth of John the Baptist</A>
(Jerusalem 6BC), the history of our salvation begins with the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss05">annunciation from the angel to Mary</A>, 
who gives her consent to the incarnation of the Verb (Nazareth, March 5BC).
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss06">Mary visits Elizabeth <I>(Magnificat)</I></A>
(Judea, April 5BC) and a few months later 
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss07">John the Baptist is born <I>(Benedictus)</I></A>
(Judea, June 5BC).
<BR>
The evangelists tell
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss08">the genealogies of Jesus</A>.
<BR>
An 
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss09">angel appears to Joseph</A> in a dream;
Joseph takes Mary to live with him at Nazareth. 
Because of the census, they travel to Bethlehem, where 
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss10">Jesus is born in the manger</A>
(Dec 5BC).
 The child receives the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss11">adoration of the shepherds</A>
and eight days later he is taken to Jerusalem for his
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss12">circumcision</A>.
<BR>
The Holy Family return to Jerusalem for the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss13">presentation in the temple</A>, where 
Simeon prophesies (Feb 4BC).
Coming back to Bethlehem, they receive the visit of
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss14">the Magi from the East</A>
and later, aware of the persecution of Herod, they 
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss15">escape to Egypt</A>.
Herod orders then the
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss16">slaughter of the innocents</A>
(Jerusalem, Dec 4BC).
<BR>
After Herod's death, the Holy Family
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss17">returns from Egypt</A>
(Oct 2AD) and they finally settle
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss18">in Nazareth.</A>
 In a trip to Jerusalem,
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss19">the child is lost and found in the temple</A>
(Mar 7AD).
During the next years 
<A HREF="c01i.html#ss20">Jesus lives silently in Nazareth</A>, with Mary and Joseph.

<BR>
The 
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss01">preaching of John the Baptist</A>
in the Jordan prepares the gospel (Jun 26).
John
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss02">reprehends the pharisees</A>,
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss03">preaches to the people</A>
and
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss04">announces the coming of the Messiah</A>.
<BR>
Jesus comes from Galilee; he is
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss05">baptized by John</A>
(Dec 26) and withdraws into the desert of Judea, where he
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss06">fasts forty days and is tempted by Satan</A>
(Jan 27).
<BR>
He returns later to the region of the Jordan, where he receives
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss07">new testimonies from the Baptist</A>
and
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss10">calls his first disciples</A>.
<BR>
He returns to Galilee and performs his first miracle in
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss14">the wedding feast at Cana</A>
(Feb 27).
<BR>After a brief
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss15">journey to Capernaum</A>, 
Jesus goes to Jerusalem to attend
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss16">the first Passover</A> during his public life (Mar 27).
 There he
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss17">expels the merchants from the temple</A>
and is 
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss18">questioned by the Jews</A>.
He reveals his condition of unique Son of God in the
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss20">conversation with Nicodemus</A>.
Thereafter he stays several months preaching in the region of Judea, 
while John the Baptist announces that
<A HREF="c02i.html#ss21">he must decrease so that Jesus grows</A> 
(April-Nov 27).

 Near the Sea of Galilee, he calls the fishermen
<A HREF="c03i.html#ss09">to fish for people</A>

At Capernaum, Jesus astounds

his <A HREF="c03i.html#ss10">numerous healings</A>.

<BR>
Jesus interrupts his first mission in Galilee to attend the

There he 
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss02">heals a paralytic on the Sabbath day</A>

<A HREF="c04i.html#ss03">He announces the resurrection</A>
and claims to be 
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss04">sent by the Father</A>.
<BR>
Returning to Galilee, he is accused because 
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss05">the disciples pick grain on Sabbath</A> (Apr 28).
The issue is aggravated when he
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss06">cures the man with a withered hand on Sabbath</A>
and
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss07">the pharisees try to kill him</A>.
Jesus then retires and begins his

performing 
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss09">several cures</A>
and promoting the enthusiasm of the people (May 28).
<BR> 
After choosing
<A HREF="c04i.html#ss10">the twelve disciples</A>, 
on a mount near the sea of Galilee, he preaches the

This epitome of the New Law, opens with the eight

exhorts to

<A HREF="c04i.html#ss27">fast without ostentation</A>.
Against

and to learn from

The sermon ends with the parable about

<BR>
Returning to Capernaum, Jesus

There are many

<A HREF="c05i.html#ss07">who are the true relatives of Christ</A>
(Ago 28).
<BR>
Beside the sea of Galilee, he preaches to a multitude a series of
<A HREF="c05i.html#ss08">Parables about the Kingdom</A>, 
<I>The sermon of the lake" </I> (Sep 28), that begins with

 Miracles and prodigies. The mission of the disciples </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sep 28 - Apr 29)
<BR>
Jesus retires away from the people, 
crosses the lake with his disciples and 
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss01">calms the winds and the waves</A>
(Sep 28).
 He disembarks in Gerasa and
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss02">expels the demons of a possessed man</A>;
the demons enter into the swine and the villagers get afraid of Jesus.
He returns then to Capernaum, where he heals the woman who had touched  
his clothes and 
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss03">raises the daughter of Jairus</A> (Oct 28).
He is
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss04">rejected in Nazareth</A>
("no one is prophet in his own country").
<BR>
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss05">He sends the twelve</A> disciples
in their first missionary tour, two by two:
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss06">"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few"</A>, 
while he starts 
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss08">another missionary tour through Galilee</A>
(Nov 28).
<BR>
About this time
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss09">Herod orders John's death</A>,
 at the request from Herodias' daughter.
Then
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss11">the disciples return and meet with Jesus</A>
(Mar 29).
They cross the lake looking for solitude, but they find a crowd 
in Bethsaida; Jesus continues teaching and healing, and in the evening
he carries out
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss12">the first miracle of the loaves</A>,
feeding 5000 men with five loaves and two fishes.
The people, enthusiastic, want to make him king; 
Jesus sends the disciples back to the boat, and he escapes to the mountain
to pray alone.
At dusk, he meet the disciples
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss13">walking upon the waters</A>, 
while they fight against the strong wind. After Peter's 
frustrated intent of walking toward Jesus on the waters, 
Jesus arrives to the boat and the storms ceases.
He continues  
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss14">healing in Genesareth</A>
and in Capernaum he exhorts the people to
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss16">look for the real food</A>; he self-proclaims as
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss17">the bread of life</A>, 
and the pharisees take offence when he says:
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss18">"My flesh is true food and my blood true drink"</A>.
Coming the
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss20">third Passover</A>, this time Jesus remains in Galilee.
Again,
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss21">Jesus reproaches the pharisees</A>
for hanging on human traditions:
 because
<A HREF="c06i.html#ss25">"it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man"</A>
(Apr 29).

Avoiding Herod's territories, Jesus undertakes a long missionary trip.
In the region of Tyre and Sidon, he consents to the request of 
<A HREF="c07i.html#ss02">the cananite woman: ("Even the dogs eat the crumbs...")</A>
 (May 29).
At Decapolis, he

feeding 4000 men.
The

Jesus answers predicting the sign of Jonah. Jesus prevents their disciples against

In Bethsaida, he
<A HREF="c07i.html#ss08">cures a blind man</A>
(Jun 29) and they continue their way towards the north.
Approaching Caesarea Philippi
<A HREF="c07i.html#ss09">Peter confesses his faith in Christ, the Son of God</A>

<A HREF="c08i.html">Section 8:</A>
To the Feast of Tabernacles, in Jerusalem </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sep 29 - Oct 29)
<BR>
Jesus leaves Galilee, and begins a 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss02">private journey to Jerusalem</A>,
to attend the Feast of Tabernacles.
As 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss03">the Samaritans refuse him hospitality</A>,
he must deviate his way through Perea, on the east side of the Jordan
(Sept 29).
During this trip, Jesus tells the
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss04">requirements for following him</A>,
he
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss05">sends out the seventy-two disciples</A>
and he
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss06">rebukes the impenitent cities</A>.
At the time of the 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss07">joyful return of the disciples</A>,
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss08">Jesus rejoices and blesses the Father</A>
for having revealed to the children.
He invites to take his yoke
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss09">("my yoke is light...")</A>
 and he proclaims
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss10">blessed the eyes that see these things</A>.
Entering Judea, he relates the
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss11">parable of the good Samaritan</A>.
 He is received
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss12">in Bethany, in the home of Mary and Martha</A>,
where he declares that "Mary has chosen the good part".
<BR>
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss13">In Jerusalem, in the feast of the Tabernacles</A>
(Oct 29), he maintains several 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss14">discussions with the Jews</A>
and he claims:
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss17">"If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!"</A>.
They asked him about
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss19">the case of the adulterous woman</A>, 
and he sentences: "He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her".
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss20">The disputes with the pharisees continue</A>;
Jesus claims to be 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss21">the light of the world</A>
and ends the discussion with the astonishing sentence:
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss24">"before Abraham existed, I am"</A>,
that leads the Jews to anger and scandal.
<BR>
Then he
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss25">cures a man born blind</A> on the Sabbath day
and the pharisees
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss27">examine the cured man and his parents</A>.
Jesus proclaims himself as 
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss29">the good shepherd</A>
who lays down his life for the sheep.
He finishes this stay in Jerusalem with
<A HREF="c08i.html#ss31">the parable of the persistent friend</A>
(Oct 29).

Leaving Jerusalem to make a brief missionary journey through Judea (Nov 29), Jesus
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss02">cures two blind men</A>
and 
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss03">casts out a daemon from a mute man</A>.
This causes

<A HREF="c09i.html#ss05">Jesus defends himself ("How can Satan cast out Satan?")</A>

<A HREF="c09i.html#ss06">the unforgivable sin</A>

He notes 
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss08">who is to be truly blessed and why</A>
and he announces
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss09">the sign of Jonah</A>.
 After the discourse about
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss10">the spiritual light</A>
it follows another
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss11">severe recrimination against the scribes and pharisees ("you took away the key...")</A>
Jesus then teaches the disciples 
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss13">how to endure the persecutions</A>.
After then he speaks against
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss16">the covetousness</A>,
teaching 
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss17">the parable of the foolish rich man</A>.
He exhorts to

<A HREF="c09i.html#ss23">baptism of fire</A>.
He requests attention to watch 
<A HREF="c09i.html#ss25">the signs of the times</A>

 On the Sabbath day, the heals

<BR>
Warned about

The Feast of Dedication. Last missionary trip</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Dec 29-Mar 30)
<BR>
Jesus returns to Jerusalem to attend
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss01">the Feast of Dedication</A>
(Dec 29); he disputes with the Jews and claims
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss02">"I and the Father are one"</A>.
<BR>
Thereafter he undertakes his last pastoral journey,
preaching in Perea,
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss03">at the places where John the Baptist baptized</A>.
He is invited to 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss04">dinner at a pharisee's house</A>
; on this occasion he
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss05">cures a dropsy man</A>
and tells the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss06">parable of the last seat</A>
and the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss08">parable of the great supper</A>.
He continues his journey and exhorts the people 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss09">to leave everything to follow him</A>.
The pharisees despise Jesus because he eats with sinners; hence he
teaches the 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss12">parables of the mercy</A>:
the 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss13">parable of the lost sheep</A>, 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss14">the lost drachma</A>
and the parable of
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss15">the prodigal son</A>.
About this time he also tells the parable of 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss16">the dishonest manager</A>
, the parable about 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss18">the rich man and Lazarus</A>
and the parable of 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss20">the good servant</A>.
<BR>
Jesus leaves Perea and returns to Bethany (Jan 30), where he
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss21">raises Lazarus from death</A>. 
The Jews conspire to stop him, and 	
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss25">Caiphas prophesies: "that one man should die for the people..."</A>.
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss26">Jesus visits Ephraim</A>
; there is much expectation in face of the next coming Passover, 
as the confrontation between Jesus and the pharisees has grown in violence.
Jesus travels to Samaria, (Feb 30) where he 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss27">cures the ten lepers</A>,
he  warns about 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss28">the Day of the Son of Man</A>.
He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss29">the  widow and the judge</A>
and compares 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss30">the pharisee and the tax collector</A>.
Travelling through Perea, he is asked about  divorce: he states that
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss31">marriage is indissoluble ("What God has joined together, let no man separate")</A>
It follows Jesus'
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss32">blessing of the little children</A>
 ("Let the children come to me") and the episode of 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss33">the rich young man</A>,
which gives him an opportunity to prevent against the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss34">danger of riches</A>
and to promise the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss35">reward of self-denial</A>.
He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss36">the vineyard laborers</A>
("the last will be first, and the first last"), and
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss37">predicts again his death and resurrection</A>;
it follows then the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss38">request of the two Zebedee</A>.
Entering Jericho  (Mar 30) he 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss39">cures a blind man</A>
and then stays 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss40">at Zacchaeus' house</A>
("the Son of Man came to save that which was lost").
He teaches  the
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss41">parable of the mina coins</A>
In Bethany,
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss42">Mary Magdalen anoints Jesus</A>; 
this action is criticized by many people, but approved by Jesus.
The Passover is few days ahead, and Jesus 
<A HREF="c10i.html#ss44">prepares his entry into Jerusalem</A>
(Mar 30).

On the Sunday before Passover (Palms Sunday) Jesus 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss01">enters triumphantly into Jerusalem</A>
sitting on a donkey, among the acclamations of the crowds.
For the second time, 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss02">he drives out the merchants from the temple</A>
; the priests ask him to rebuke the people, and Jesus answers:
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss04">"if these were silent, the stones would cry out!"</A>.
 At dusk, he 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss05">comes back to Bethany</A>, to  Lazarus' home.
<BR>
Next  day (Monday) he 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss06">returns to Jerusalem</A>
; during this excursion, he
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss07">curses the barren fig tree</A>
and thereafter he again
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss08">comes back to Bethany</A>.
<BR>
In the next morning  (Tuesday) they find
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss09">the withered fig</A>.
 In the temple of Jerusalem he
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss11">teaches and disputes with the priests</A>.
 He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss13">the two sons</A>
and the
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss14">parable of the wicked farmers</A>.
The pharisees and sadducees ask him about several questions:
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss16">Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar?</A>, 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss17">Will the dead resurrect?</A>,
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss18">Which is the First Commandment?</A>.
Before the hostility of the pharisees, Jesus pronounces his last and harsh
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss20">recrimination against the pharisees: ("Hypocrites! whitened tombs!")</A>
<BR>
After the episode of
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss21">the widow's mite</A>
and the

he again 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss23">announces his Passion ("unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies...")</A>
and a voice is heard from the sky.
<BR>
Afterwards Jesus pronounces 
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss25">the Eschatological Discourse</A>,
 about the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the world and Christ's return with glory.
He keeps
<A HREF="c11i.html#ss36">preaching in the temple</A>,
 and tells the

The Passion of Jesus </B>(Passover 30 - Thursday night and Friday)
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Jesus and the apostles cross the city towards the garden of Gethsemane,
outside Jerusalem (Thursday night).
Peter, James and John witness 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss01">the agony of Jesus</A>,
who prays to the Father and is comforted by an angel.
Soon Judas arrives with the soldiers;
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss02">Jesus is arrested</A>
and the disciples forsake him.
<BR>
The <I>ecclesiastical trial </I>begins: at first he is led
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss08">to Annas</A>,
who sends him 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss11">to Caiphas</A>
(after midnight).
It follows a first examination
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss12">before Caiphas and the priests of the Sanhedrin</A>,
when
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss14">Jesus confesses and is condemned</A>.
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss15">Peter denies him</A>
and
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss16">Jesus is mocked and beat</A> by the Jews.
About dawn (Friday)
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss17">the Sanedrin meets and ratifies Jesus' condemnation</A>;
he is sent
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss18">to Pilatus</A>.
 Meanwhile
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss19">Judas repents, despairs and dies</A>.
<BR>
It begins then the <I>civil trial </I>,
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss20">before Pilatus</A>.
After a
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss21">first examination</A>,
 he sends him 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss23">to Herod Antipas</A>.
Jesus keeps silent, is mocked by Herod
and sent back to Pilatus dressed in purple.
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss24">Pilatus declares him innocent</A>
but, in order to please the jewish priests,
he let the people choose between
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss26">Jesus and Barabbas</A>;
 the people prefers
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss27">Barabbas' liberation.</A>
Jesus is
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss28">flogged</A>,
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss29">crowned with thorns</A>
and exposed to the people:
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss30">"Ecce homo!"</A>;
the Jews insist on requesting his death.
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss31">Pilatus examines Jesus again</A>
brings him out to the Jews, and wash his hands;
finally, he reluctantly sentences him to be crucified.
<BR>
(Friday morning) On the way 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss33">to the Golgotha carrying the cross</A>,
 Jesus is helped by Simon of Cirene; he speaks to 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss34">the mourning women</A>.
He is
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss35">crucified</A>,
 between 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss36">the two robbers</A>.
 The soldiers
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss39">divide his clothing</A>,
 the passing people blasphem and mock at him:
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss40">"Save yourself, if you are the Son of God!"</A>.
He pronounces the last <I>Seven words:</I>
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss38">1: "Father, forgive them..."</A>,

<A HREF="c13i.html#ss41">2: "Today you will be with me in paradise"</A>,

About noon, 
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss48">Jesus dies</A>,
 the sun is darkened and the veil of the temple is torn in two.
<BR>
After a soldier pierces his side,
he is
<A HREF="c13i.html#ss52">taken down from the cross and buried</A>
by Joseph of Arimatea (Friday afternoon).
<BR>
On the Sabbath day, while the women prepare

 Resurrection, appearances and ascension </B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Sunday of Glory - May 30)
<BR>
The women bring ointments to sepulchre (Sunday, very early),
but they find
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss03">the grave empty</A>.
 While
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss04">Mary Magdalen runs to tell Peter</A>,

<A HREF="c14i.html#ss05">an angel appears to the other women</A>
and tells them that Jesus has risen.
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss07">Peter and John hasten to the tomb</A>
and inspect it.
 Meanwhile,
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss08">Jesus appears to Mary Magdalen</A>
that had been weeping outside <I>(noli me tangere)</I>.
The same day, he appears to other women, to Peter and to 
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss10">the disciples of Emmaus</A>,
who return to Jerusalem to bring the news.
Finally, that afternoon, 
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss12">Jesus appears to the apostles</A>
in a close room, and eats with them.
<BR>
Eight days later it happens a
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss13">new appearance</A>,
 and Thomas at last believes.
 In another
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss14">appearance in the sea of Tiberias</A>
to seven pupils, he
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss15">talks with Pedro and confirms his primacy</A>. 
After another
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss17">appearance on a mountain in Galilee</A>,
 and forty days after his resurrection, 
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss18">Jesus parts from the disciples</A>:
on the Mount of Olivet (between Jerusalem and Bethany)
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss19">he ascends into heaven</A>.
<BR>
It follows then the
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss20">joyful return of the disciples</A>
and the
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss21">beginning of the great mission</A>.
<BR>
<A HREF="c14i.html#ss22">John ends his gospel</A>
declaring:
<FONT COLOR=#336600">
"Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not
written in this book; but these are written, that 
<B>
you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that
 believing you may have life in his name"
