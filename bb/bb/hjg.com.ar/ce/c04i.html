 Second Passover at Jerusalem and second mission at Galilee: the Sermon on the mount</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Mar 28 - May 28)
<BR>
Jesus interrupts his first mission in Galilee to attend the
<A HREF="#ss01">second Passover in Jerusalem</A> (Mar 28).
There he 
<A HREF="#ss02">heals a paralytic on the Sabbath day</A>
and the anger of the pharisees grows.
<A HREF="#ss03">He announces the resurrection</A>
and claims to be 
<A HREF="#ss04">sent by the Father</A>.
<BR>
Returning to Galilee, he is accused because 
<A HREF="#ss05">the disciples pick grain on Sabbath</A> (Apr 28).
The issue is aggravated when he
<A HREF="#ss06">cures the man with a withered hand on Sabbath</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss07">the pharisees try to kill him</A>.
Jesus then retires and begins his
<A HREF="#ss08">second missionary tour at Galilee</A>, 
performing 
<A HREF="#ss09">several cures</A>
and promoting the enthusiasm of the people (May 28).
<BR> 
After choosing
<A HREF="#ss10">the twelve disciples</A>, 
on a mount near the sea of Galilee, he preaches the
<A HREF="#ss11">Sermon of the mount</A>.
<BR>
This epitome of the New Law, opens with the eight
<A HREF="#ss12">beatitudes</A>;
it compares the apostolic vocation with
<A HREF="#ss13">the salt</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss14">the light</A>;  points out the relationship between
<A HREF="#ss15">the old law and the new law</A>; exhorts to
<A HREF="#ss17">the reconciliation with the enemy</A>, 
praises the chastity of heart
<A HREF="#ss18">("If your right eye causes you to sin...")</A>
, rejects
<A HREF="#ss19">the divorce</A> and <A HREF="c04i.html#ss20">swearing</A>; teaches
<A HREF="#ss23">how to do merciful deeds</A> and
<A HREF="#ss24">how to pray</A> (<A HREF="c04i.html#ss25">the Our Father</A>); 
exhorts to
<A HREF="#ss26">forgive</A> and to
<A HREF="#ss27">fast without ostentation</A>.
Against
<A HREF="#ss28">the worldly worries</A>, he admonishes to look for
<A HREF="#ss29">the treasures of heaven</A>
and to learn from 
<A HREF="#ss32">the lilies of the field and the birds of the sky</A>.
 He prevents against 
<A HREF="#ss34">judgement ("the speck in your neighbor's eye ")</A>,
<A HREF="#ss35">unadvised zeal ("Do not give what is holy to dogs")</A>
and
<A HREF="#ss36">bad prayer ("knock, and it will be opened")</A>.
He advises to enter through
<A HREF="#ss38">the narrow gate</A>,  
teaches to distinguish
<A HREF="#ss39">the false prophets ("You will know them by their fruits")</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss40">necessity of the works of faith</A>.
The sermon ends with the parable about 
<A HREF="#ss41">the man that built the house on rock</A>.
<BR>
Returning to Capernaum, Jesus 
<A HREF="#ss43">cures the centurion's servant ("Lord, I am not worthy for you to come under my roof....")</A>,
who is praised for his faith (May 28).

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:2</FONT>&nbsp; Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, &quot;Bethesda,&quot; having five porches. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:3</FONT>&nbsp; In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:4</FONT>&nbsp; for an angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the pool, and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:5</FONT>&nbsp; A certain man was there, who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:6</FONT>&nbsp; When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, &quot;Do you want to be made well?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:7</FONT>&nbsp; The sick man answered him, &quot;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I'm coming, another steps down before me.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:8</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to him, &quot;Arise, take up your mat, and walk.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:9</FONT>&nbsp; Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:10</FONT>&nbsp; So the Jews said to him who was cured, &quot;It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:11</FONT>&nbsp; He answered them, &quot;He who made me well, the same said to me, 'Take up your mat, and walk.'&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:12</FONT>&nbsp; Then they asked him, &quot;Who is the man who said to you, 'Take up your mat, and walk'?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:13</FONT>&nbsp; But he who was healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:14</FONT>&nbsp; Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, &quot;Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:15</FONT>&nbsp; The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <BR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR=#F0F0e9><FONT SIZE=-1><FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:16</FONT>&nbsp; For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:17</FONT>&nbsp; But Jesus answered them, &quot;My Father is still working, so I am working, too.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:18</FONT>&nbsp; For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:19</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus therefore answered them, &quot;Most assuredly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:20</FONT>&nbsp; For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:21</FONT>&nbsp; For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:22</FONT>&nbsp; For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:23</FONT>&nbsp; that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:24</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Most assuredly I tell you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and doesn't come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:25</FONT>&nbsp; Most assuredly, I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice; and those who hear will live. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:26</FONT>&nbsp; For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:27</FONT>&nbsp; He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:28</FONT>&nbsp; Don't marvel at this, for the hour comes, in which all that are in the tombs will hear his voice, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:29</FONT>&nbsp; and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:30</FONT>&nbsp; I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>5:41</FONT>&nbsp; I don't receive glory from men. <BR>
