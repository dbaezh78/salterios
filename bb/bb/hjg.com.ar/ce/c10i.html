<A HREF="c10i.html">Section 10:</A>
The Feast of Dedication. Last missionary trip</B>
<FONT SIZE=-1>(Dec 29-Mar 30)
<BR>
Jesus returns to Jerusalem to attend
<A HREF="#ss01">the Feast of Dedication</A>
(Dec 29); he disputes with the Jews and claims
<A HREF="#ss02">"I and the Father are one"</A>.
<BR>
Thereafter he undertakes his last pastoral journey,
preaching in Perea,
<A HREF="#ss03">at the places where John the Baptist baptized</A>.
He is invited to 
<A HREF="#ss04">dinner at a pharisee's house</A>
; on this occasion he
<A HREF="#ss05">cures a dropsy man</A>
and tells the
<A HREF="#ss06">parable of the last seat</A>
and the
<A HREF="#ss08">parable of the great supper</A>.
He continues his journey and exhorts the people 
<A HREF="#ss09">to leave everything to follow him</A>.
The pharisees despise Jesus because he eats with sinners; hence he
teaches the 
<A HREF="#ss12">parables of the mercy</A>:
the 
<A HREF="#ss13">parable of the lost sheep</A>, 
<A HREF="#ss14">the lost drachma</A>
and the parable of
<A HREF="#ss15">the prodigal son</A>.
About this time he also tells the parable of 
<A HREF="#ss16">the dishonest manager</A>
, the parable about 
<A HREF="#ss18">the rich man and Lazarus</A>
and the parable of 
<A HREF="#ss20">the good servant</A>.
<BR>
Jesus leaves Perea and returns to Bethany (Jan 30), where he
<A HREF="#ss21">raises Lazarus from death</A>. 
The Jews conspire to stop him, and 	
<A HREF="#ss25">Caiphas prophesies: "that one man should die for the people..."</A>.
<A HREF="#ss26">Jesus visits Ephraim</A>
; there is much expectation in face of the next coming Passover, 
as the confrontation between Jesus and the pharisees has grown in violence.
Jesus travels to Samaria, (Feb 30) where he 
<A HREF="#ss27">cures the ten lepers</A>,
he  warns about 
<A HREF="#ss28">the Day of the Son of Man</A>.
He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="#ss29">the  widow and the judge</A>
and compares 
<A HREF="#ss30">the pharisee and the tax collector</A>.
Travelling through Perea, he is asked about  divorce: he states that
<A HREF="#ss31">marriage is indissoluble ("What God has joined together, let no man separate")</A>
It follows Jesus'
<A HREF="#ss32">blessing of the little children</A>
 ("Let the children come to me") and the episode of 
<A HREF="#ss33">the rich young man</A>,
which gives him an opportunity to prevent against the
<A HREF="#ss34">danger of riches</A>
and to promise the
<A HREF="#ss35">reward of self-denial</A>.
He tells the parable of 
<A HREF="#ss36">the vineyard laborers</A>
("the last will be first, and the first last"), and
<A HREF="#ss37">predicts again his death and resurrection</A>;
it follows then the
<A HREF="#ss38">request of the two Zebedee</A>.
Entering Jericho  (Mar 30) he 
<A HREF="#ss39">cures a blind man</A>
and then stays 
<A HREF="#ss40">at Zacchaeus' house</A>
("the Son of Man came to save that which was lost").
He teaches  the
<A HREF="#ss41">parable of the mina coins</A>
In Bethany,
<A HREF="#ss42">Mary Magdalen anoints Jesus</A>; 
this action is criticized by many people, but approved by Jesus.
The Passover is few days ahead, and Jesus 
<A HREF="#ss44">prepares his entry into Jerusalem</A>
(Mar 30).

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:23</FONT>&nbsp; It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's porch. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:24</FONT>&nbsp; The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, &quot;How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:25</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &quot;I told you, and you don't believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, these testify about me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:26</FONT>&nbsp; But you don't believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:27</FONT>&nbsp; My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:28</FONT>&nbsp; I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:29</FONT>&nbsp; My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:30</FONT>&nbsp; I and the Father are one.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:31</FONT>&nbsp;  Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:32</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &quot;I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:33</FONT>&nbsp; The Jews answered him, &quot;We don't stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:34</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus answered them, &quot;Isn't it written in your law, 'I said, you are gods?' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:35</FONT>&nbsp; If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken), <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:36</FONT>&nbsp; Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You blaspheme,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God?' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:37</FONT>&nbsp; If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:38</FONT>&nbsp; But if I do them, though you don't believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:39</FONT>&nbsp; They sought again to seize him, and he went out of their hand. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:2</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:3</FONT>&nbsp; and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, but they would not come. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:4</FONT>&nbsp; Again he sent out other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, &quot;Behold, I have made ready my dinner. My oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the marriage feast!&quot;' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:5</FONT>&nbsp; But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:6</FONT>&nbsp; and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:7</FONT>&nbsp; When the king heard that, he was angry, and he sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:8</FONT>&nbsp; &quot;Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren't worthy. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:9</FONT>&nbsp; Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the marriage feast.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:10</FONT>&nbsp; Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:11</FONT>&nbsp; But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on wedding clothing, <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:12</FONT>&nbsp; and he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?' He was speechless. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:13</FONT>&nbsp; Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness; there is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>22:14</FONT>&nbsp; For many are called, but few chosen.&quot; <A HREF="c11i.html#ss16"><IMG SRC="img/nv.gif" BORDER=0></A><BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>14:17</FONT>&nbsp; He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited, 'Come, for everything is ready now.' <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>14:18</FONT>&nbsp; They all as one began to make excuses. &quot;The first said to him, 'I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.' <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:19</FONT>&nbsp; Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:20</FONT>&nbsp; Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:21</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore Martha said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:22</FONT>&nbsp; Even now I know that, whatever you ask of God, God will give you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:23</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to her, &quot;Your brother will rise again.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:24</FONT>&nbsp; Martha said to him, &quot;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:25</FONT>&nbsp; Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet will he live. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:26</FONT>&nbsp; Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:27</FONT>&nbsp; She said to him, &quot;Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Christ, God's Son, he who comes into the world.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:28</FONT>&nbsp; When she had said this, she went away, and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, &quot;The Teacher is here, and is calling you.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:29</FONT>&nbsp; When she heard this, she arose quickly, and went to him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:30</FONT>&nbsp; Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met him. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:31</FONT>&nbsp; Then the Jews who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, &quot;She is going to the tomb to weep there.&quot; <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:32</FONT>&nbsp; Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, &quot;Lord, if you would have been here, my brother wouldn't have died.&quot; <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:41</FONT>&nbsp; So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, &quot;Father, I thank you that you listened to me. <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>11:51</FONT>&nbsp; Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:43</FONT>&nbsp; But it shall not be so among you, but whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:44</FONT>&nbsp; Whoever of you wants to become first among you, shall be bondservant of all. <BR>
<FONT SIZE=-1 COLOR=#666666>10:45</FONT>&nbsp; For the Son of Man also came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot; <BR>
